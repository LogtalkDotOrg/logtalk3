About
-----

Logtalk is a *declarative object-oriented logic programming language* that
extends and leverages the Prolog language with a feature set suitable for
programming in the large. Logtalk supports modern code encapsulation and
code reuse mechanisms while preserving the declarative programming features
of Prolog.

Logtalk is implemented as a trans-compiler in highly portable code and can
use most modern and standards compliant Prolog implementations as a backend
compiler.

As a multi-paradigm language, Logtalk includes support for both *prototypes*
and *classes*, *protocols* (*interfaces*), *categories* (components and
hot-patching), *event-driven programming*, *coinduction*, *lambda expressions*,
and *high-level multi-threading programming*. Logtalk uses standard Prolog
syntax with the addition of some operators and directives for a smooth learning
path.

Logtalk is distributed under a commercial friendly license and includes full
documentation, tutorials, portable libraries, a comprehensive set of portable
developer tools, and numerous programming examples to help get you started.

Logtalk development adheres to the Contributor Covenant
[code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating,
you are expected to uphold this code. Please report
unacceptable behavior to contact@logtalk.org.


Logtalk website
---------------

The latest stable release of the Logtalk is always available at:

https://logtalk.org/

At this address you can download installers for your operating-system and
find full documentation on Logtalk.


Installation
------------

Logtalk can be installed either from sources by running a couple of shell
scripts or by using an [installer](https://logtalk.org/download.html) for your
operating system. For manual installation, see the [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md)
file for detailed instructions.

See the [user manual](manuals/index.html) for a description of the source
files organization and for usage instructions.

If you are upgrading from a previous Logtalk version, please check the
[UPGRADING.md](UPGRADING.md) file for instructions on how to upgrade your
programs or your custom adapter files to run under this new version.


Customization
-------------

The [CUSTOMIZE.md](CUSTOMIZE.md) file provides detailed instructions for
customizing the Logtalk installation and working environment.


Running
-------

The [QUICK_START.md](QUICK_START.md) file provides quick instructions for
those of you in a hurry to run Logtalk, provided that your favorite Prolog
compiler is supported and installed.


Documentation
-------------

A quick and highly recommended introduction for users comfortable with Prolog
and with general knowledge about object-oriented programming is available at
the [Learn X in Y minutes](https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/logtalk/) website.

The reference and user manuals are provided in HTML format and can be found in
the [manuals](manuals/) directory. They are also available online at:

https://logtalk.org/manuals/index.html

The [RELEASE_NOTES.md](RELEASE_NOTES.md) file contains descriptions of all
Logtalk updates since the first public version. Please check it if you are
upgrading from a previous Logtalk version.

The API documentation for the core, library, tools, and contributions is
provided in HTML format and can be found in the [docs](docs/) directory and
also available online at:

https://logtalk.org/docs/index.html

Most directories include `NOTES.md` or `NOTES.txt` documentation files.

On POSIX systems, there's also a [man page](man/man1) for most shell scripts.
A list of these scripts can be generated using the `apropos logtalk` command.
[HTML versions](https://logtalk.org/man/) of the man pages are also available
at the Logtalk website.


Registration
------------

To register as a Logtalk user please use the registration form at:

https://logtalk.org/regform.html

Registration is optional. But it's also a way of showing your support and
an opportunity for us to learn about the cool projects where you will be
using Logtalk.
