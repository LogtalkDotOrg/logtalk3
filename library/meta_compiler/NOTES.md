`meta_compiler`
===============

This library supports implementations optimized compilation of meta-calls
for the predicates defined in the `meta` library. 


API documentation
-----------------

Open the [../../docs/library_index.html#meta-compiler](../../docs/library_index.html#meta-compiler)
link in a web browser.


Loading
-------

To load the main entities in this library, load the `loader.lgt` file:

	| ?- logtalk_load(meta_compiler(loader)).


Testing
-------

To test this library predicates, load the `tester.lgt` file:

	| ?- logtalk_load(meta_compiler(tester)).


Usage
-----

If `meta_compiler` is the only hook object you are using, you can set it as
the default hook object (but note that the optimizations are only applied
to entities compiled with the `optimize` flag turned on):

	| ?- set_logtalk_flag(hook, meta_compiler).
	...

Otherwise, use the `hook(meta_compiler)` and `optimize(on)` complier options
when compiling and loading the code that you want to optimize. For example:

	| ?- logtalk_load(my_source_file, [hook(meta_compiler), optimize(on)]).
	...


See also the `metapredicates_compiled` example and unit tests.


Known issues
------------

Goals in clauses containing parameter variables are currently not expanded
by this library and thus not optimized.
