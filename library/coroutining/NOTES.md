`coroutining`
=============

The `coroutining` object provides a portable abstraction over how common
coroutining predicates are made available by the supported backend Prolog
systems (ECLiPSe, LVM, SICStus Prolog, SWI-Prolog, Trealla Prolog, and YAP)
that provide them. Partial support for XSB is provided (the predicate
`frozen/2` is not available and calls to it fail).

Calls to the library predicates are inlined when compiled with the `optimize`
flag turned on. In this case, there is no overhead compared with calling the
abstracted predicates directly.
