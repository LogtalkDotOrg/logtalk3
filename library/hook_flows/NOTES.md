`hook_flows`
============

Hook objects (i.e. objects that define term- and goal-expansion rules)
can be combined to define expansion *workflows*. While in some cases
the expansions are independent and thus can be applied in any order,
in other cases a specific order is required. The `hook_pipeline` and
`hook_set` parametric objects in this library implement the two most
common scenarios of combining multiple hook objects for the expansion
of source files. These parametric hook objects can be combined to
define workflows of any complexity (e.g. a pipeline where one of the
steps is set with an element that is a pipeline). These two basic hook
flows can also used as examples of how to construct your own custom
expansion workflows.

Loading
-------

To load all entities in this library, load the `loader.lgt` file:

	| ?- logtalk_load(hook_flows(loader)).


Testing
-------

To test this library predicates, load the `tester.lgt` file:

	| ?- logtalk_load(hook_flows(tester)).


Usage
-----

Pre-processing a source file with a hook object can be accomplished by either
compiling the source file using the option `hook(HookObject)` or by adding to
the top of the file the directive:

	:- set_logtalk_flag(hook, HookObject).

Note that `set_logtalk_flag/2` directives are local to an entity or a source
file.

The `hook_pipeline(Pipeline)` is a parametric object where the parameter is a
list of hook objects, interpreted as a pre-processing pipeline: the results of
a hook object are passed to the next hook object. Terms and goals that are not
expanded by a hook object are passed as-is to the next hook object. This
parametric object is used when a set of expansions must be applied in a
specific order. It also allows overriding the default compiler semantics where
term-expansion rules are tried in sequence only until one of them succeeds.

The `hook_set(Set)` is a parametric object where the parameter is a list of
hook objects, interpreted as a set of hook objects. The hook objects are tried
in sequence until one of them succeeds in expanding the current term (goal)
into a different term (goal). This parametric object is used when applying
multiple independent expansions (i.e. expansions that don't apply to the same
terms or goals).

Both the `hook_pipeline(Pipeline)` and `hook_set(Set)` objects assume that the
individual hook objects publicly implement the `expanding` protocol (this is
the default) as they send `term_expansion/2` and `goal_expansion/2` messages
to those objects.

When using a backend Prolog compiler that supports modules, it's also possible
to use as parameter a list of hook modules as long as their names do not
coincide with the names of loaded objects.
