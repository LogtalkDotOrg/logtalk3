To load all entities in this group load the `dependents_loader.lgt`
utility file:

	| ?- logtalk_load(library(dependents_loader)).

The `observer` and `subject` categories implement the Smalltalk 
dependents handling mechanism. This mechanism can be used as an
alternative to Logtalk's system-wide support for event-driven
programming.
