Redis client library. Supports GNU Prolog, Qu-Prolog, SICStus Prolog,
SWI-Prolog, and XSB. Support for ECLiPSe is also included but requires
a fix for an ECLiPSe bug that is expected in a forthcoming version of
this Prolog system.

For general information on Redis, including a list of the available
commands, visit:

	https://redis.io

To load this library, load the `redis_loader.lgt` utility file:

	| ?- logtalk_load(library(redis_loader)).

Recent version of macOS seem to disable the mapping of `localhost` to
`127.0.0.1`. This issue may prevent running this library unit tests
and the `redis::connect/1` from working. This can be fixed either by
editing the `/etc/hosts file or by using in alternative the predicate
`redis::connect/3` with `'127.0.0.1'` as fist argument.
