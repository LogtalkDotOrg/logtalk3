`random`
========

This library provides portable random number generators and an abstraction
over native backend Prolog compiler random number generator if available.

Loading
-------

To load all entities in this library, load the `loader.lgt` file:

	| ?- logtalk_load(random(loader)).


Testing
-------

To test this library predicates, load the `tester.lgt` file:

	| ?- logtalk_load(random(tester)).


Usage
-----

The `random` object implements portable random number generator and
supports multiple random number generators, using different seeds,
by defining derived objects. For example:

	:- object(my_random_generator_1,
		extends(random)).
	
		:- initialization(::reset_seed).

	:- end_object.

The `fast_random` object also implements a portable random number
generator but does not support deriving multiple random number
generators, which makes it a bit faster than the `random` object.

The `random` and `fast_random` objects manage the random number generator
seed using internal dynamic state. The predicates that update the seed
are declared as synchronized (when running on Prolog backends that support
threads). Still, care must be taken when using these objects from
multi-threaded applications as there is not portable solution to protect
seed updates from signals and prevent inconsistent state when threads are
canceled.

The `random` and `fast_random` objects always initialize the random generator
seed to the same value, thus providing a pseudo random number generator. The
``randomize/1`` predicate can be used to initialize the seed with a random
value.

The `backend_random` object abstracts the native backend Prolog compiler
random number generator for the basic `random/1`, `get_seed/1`, and `set_seed/1`
predicates providing a portable implementation for the remaining predicates.
This makes the object stateless, which can allow reliable use from multiple
threads. Consult the backend Prolog compiler documentation for details on
its random number generator properties. Note that several of the supported
backend Prolog systems, notably B-Prolog, CxProlog, ECLiPSe, JIProlog, Lean
Prolog, Qu-Prolog, and Quintus Prolog, do not provide implementations for
both the `get_seed/1` and `set_seed/1` predicates and calling these predicates
simply succeed without performing any action.
