To load all entities in this library load the `random_loader.lgt` utility
file:

	| ?- logtalk_load(library(random_loader)).

The `random` object implements portable random number generator and
supports multiple random number generators, using different seeds,
by defining derived objects. For example:

	:- object(my_random_generator_1,
		extends(ramdom)).
	
		:- intialization(::reset_seed).

	:- end_object.

The `fast_random` object also implements a portable random number
generator but does not support deriving multiple random number
generators.

The `random` and `fast_random` objects manage the random number
generator seed using internal dynamic state. Care must be taken
when using these objects from multi-threaded applications as there
is not portable solution to protect seed updates from signals and
prevent inconsistent state when threads are canceled.

The `backend_random` object uses the native backend Prolog compiler
random number generator for the basic random/1, get_seed/1, and
set_seed/1 predicates and a portable implementation for all the
remaining predicates. This makes the object stateless, which can
allow reliable use from multiple threads. Consult the backend
Prolog compiler documentation for details on its random number
generator properties.
