To load all entities in this library load the `random_loader.lgt` utility
file:

	| ?- logtalk_load(library(random_loader)).

The `random` object implements portable random number generators and
supports multiple random number generators, using different seeds, by
defining derived objects. For example:

	:- object(my_random_generator_1,
		extends(ramdom)).
	
		:- intialization(::reset_seed).

	:- end_object.

The `frandom` object is a faster version of the `random` object but
cannot be extended. Useful when a single random number generator is
required.
