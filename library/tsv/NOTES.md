`tsv`
=====

The `tsv` library provides predicates for reading and writing TSV files
and streams:

https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/text/tab-separated-values

The main object, `tsv/1`, is a parametric object allowing passing a single
option for the handling of the header of the file (`keep` or `skip`). The
`tvs` object extends the `tsv/1` parametric object using the default `keep`
option value.

Files and streams can be read into a list of rows (with each row being
represented by a list of fields) or asserted using a user-defined dynamic
predicate. Reading can be done by first loading the whole file (using the
`read_file/2-3` predicates) into memory or line by line (using the
`read_file_by_line/2-3` predicates). Reading line by line is usually the
best option for parsing large TSV files. 

Data can be saved to a TSV file or stream by providing the object and
predicate for accessing the data plus the name of the destination file
or the stream handle or alias.


API documentation
-----------------

Open the [../../apis/library_index.html#tsv](../../apis/library_index.html#tsv)
link in a web browser.


Loading
-------

To load all entities in this library, load the `loader.lgt` file:

	| ?- logtalk_load(tsv(loader)).


Testing
-------

To test this library predicates, load the `tester.lgt` file:

	| ?- logtalk_load(tsv(tester)).


Usage
-----

A TSV file can be read as a list of rows:

	| ?- tsv::read_file('test_files/data.tsv', Rows).

	Rows = [['Name','Age','Address'], ['Paul',23,'1115 W Franklin'], ['Bessy the Cow',5,'Big Farm Way'], ['Zeke,45,'W Main St']]
	yes

Alternatively, The TSV data can be saved using a public and dynamic object
predicate (that must be previously declared). For example:

	| ?- assertz(p(_,_,_)), retractall(p(_,_,_)).
	yes

	| ?- tsv(skip)::read_file('test_files/data.tsv', user, p/3).
	yes

	| ?-  p(A,B,C).

	A = 'Paul', B = 23, C = '1115 W Franklin' ? ;
	...

Given a predicate representing a table, the predicate data can be written to
a file or stream. For example:

	| ?- tsv::write_file('output.tsv', user, p/3).
	yes
