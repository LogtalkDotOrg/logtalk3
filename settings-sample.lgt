/*
About
-----

This is a sample settings file for Logtalk that can be used to override
the default flag values in the backend Prolog compiler adapter files, to
automatically load at startup libraries and tools, and to perform other
initializations (including backend specific ones).

Settings files are specially useful when Logtalk is installed system-wide
in a read-only directory. Using settings files allows Logtalk to easily
support user-specific and project-specific settings. Note that the settings
defined here can always be overridden by using the `logtalk_compile/2` and
`logtalk_load/2` built-in predicates or by using the `set_logtalk_flag/2`
directive within the source files.

Settings files are also a convenient place to define your own shortcuts
for commonly used queries (e.g. load the debugger and start tracing).


Settings file locations
-----------------------

Logtalk looks for a settings file in the following directories and order:

- Startup directory (``$LOGTALK_STARTUP_DIRECTORY``)
- Logtalk user directory (``$LOGTALKUSER``)
- User home directory (``$HOME``; ``%USERPROFILE%`` on Windows if ``%HOME%`` is not defined)
- Application data directory (``%APPDATA%\Logtalk``; only on Windows)
- Config directory (``$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/logtalk``)
- Default config directory (``$HOME/.config/logtalk/``)

The `LOGTALK_STARTUP_DIRECTORY` environment variable provides support for
per-project setting files. The POSIX integration scripts automatically set
this variable. On Windows systems, the integration shortcuts "Start in"
field is set by default to `%LOGTALKUSER%` as the `%CD%` alternative only
works on some Windows versions. A workaround to use per-project settings
files is to copy the shortcut to the project directory and and edit its
"Target" field to prefix its content with:

	C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe /c set LOGTALK_STARTUP_DIRECTORY=%CD% &&

When the `LOGTALK_STARTUP_DIRECTORY` variable is not available, Logtalk
uses the current directory as returned by the backend Prolog compiler.

If no settings file is found, Logtalk will use the default flag values
defined in the backend Prolog compiler adapter file. It's however possible
to restrict searching of settings files to the Logtalk user directory and
to the home directory or to disable settings files by changing the
definition of the read-only flag `settings_file` in the used Prolog
adapter file from `allow` to, respectively, `restrict` or `deny`.


Defining a settings file
------------------------

To use settings files, copy this file to one of the supported locations
listed above, rename it to `settings.lgt`, customize it (see the sample
code below), and start Logtalk from the project directory (if you're
using a project specific settings file) or from anywhere (when using a
default settings file).

Note that, for setting Logtalk flag values, you must use the predicate
`set_logtalk_flag/2` (wrapped in a `initialization/1` directive) as the
scope of the `set_logtalk_flag/2` directive is local to the entity or
the source file containing it.

If you use multiple backend Prolog compilers and want to define per
compiler settings, you can use the Logtalk conditional compilation
directives and the `prolog_dialect` compiler flag. See the User and
Reference Manuals for details.


Caveats
-------

Logtalk compiles and loads settings files silently but a warning will
be printed by default if syntax errors are found. Be sure to debug and
test your settings files as regular Logtalk source files before using
them (you may use the `logtalk_compile/1-2` built-in predicates to compile
the settings files without loading them to check for errors and warnings).

Limitations of the backend Prolog compilers may prevent settings files
to work from directories other than the Logtalk user directory, specially
when running on non-POSIX operating systems such as Windows. Check the
`adapters/NOTES.md` file for compatibility details.
