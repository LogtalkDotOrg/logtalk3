`make`
======

Logtalk provides a make tool supporting several targets using the
`logtalk_make/0-1` built-in predicates. Top-level shortcuts for the
targets are also provided.


API documentation
-----------------

To consult the documentation of the `logtalk_make/0-1` built-in
predicates, open in a web browser the links:

- [../refman/predicates/logtalk_make_0.html](../refman/predicates/logtalk_make_0.html)
- [../refman/predicates/logtalk_make_1.html](../refman/predicates/logtalk_make_1.html)

There is also a user-defined hook predicate that supports defining additional
actions for the make targets (e.g. running tests automatically on make check):
