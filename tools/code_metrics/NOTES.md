Overview
--------

The purpose of this tool is to assess qualities of source code that may
predict negative aspects such as complexity, error-proneness, and overall
maintainability. It is meant to be extensible via the addition of metric
objects into the `metric/` sub-directory. At the time of writing (2017/1/11),
this metrics tool comes with three metrics out of the box: `Number of Clauses`,
`Depth of Inheritance`, and `Coupling Score`. The method of scoring was
strongly influenced by the metrics rating system in Microsoft Visual Studio and
aims to eventually emulate the functionality of a maintainability index score.
Please see `SCRIPT.txt` for common examples of usage.


Loading
-------

This tool can be loaded using the query:

	| ?- logtalk_load(code_metrics(loader)).


Issues
------

It's currently unknown whether the first argument for `item_score/2` should
support any non-entities, hence the name was changed from `entity_score/2`
to `item_score/2`. Therefore, the initial version of this tool may introduce
some mental ambiguity. This issue should be resolved as the tool matures.
