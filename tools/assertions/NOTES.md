`assertions`
============

The `assertions.lgt` file contains definitions for two meta-predicates,
`assertion/1-2`, which allows the use of assertions on your source code to
print warning and error messages (using the message printing mechanism).
The `assertions_messages.lgt` file defines the default message translations
generated when assertions succeed, fail, or throw an exception.


API documentation
-----------------

This tool API documentation is available at:

[../../docs/library_index.html#assertions](../../docs/library_index.html#assertions)


Loading
-------

This tool can be loaded using the query:

	| ?- logtalk_load(assertions(loader)).


Testing
-------

To test this tool, load the `tester.lgt` file:

	| ?- logtalk_load(assertions(tester)).


Adding assertions to your source code
-------------------------------------

The `assertion/1` predicate takes a goal as argument. For example:

	foo(L) :-
		assertions::assertion(non_empty_list(L)),
		...

The `assertion/2` predicate takes as arguments a term for passing
context information and a goal. Using again a unit test as an example:

	foo(L) :-
		assertions::assertion(foo_list_alerts, non_empty_list(L)),
		...

When using a large number of assertions, you can use a lighter syntax
by adding a `uses/2` directive. For example:

	:- uses(assertions, [assertion/1, assertion/2]).


Automatically adding file and line context information to assertions
--------------------------------------------------------------------

The `assertions/1` parametric object can be used as a hook object to
automatically add file and line context information, represented by the
term `file_lines(File, BeginLine-EndLine)`, to calls to the `assertion/1`
predicate by goal-expanding it to calls to the `assertion/2` predicate
(the expansion assumes that a `uses/2` directive is being used in the code
that will be expanded to direct `assertion/1` calls to the `assertions`
object). For example, assuming the file using assertions is named `source`,
it would be compiled and loaded using the call:

	logtalk_load(source, [hook(assertions(debug))])


Suppressing assertion calls from source code
--------------------------------------------

The `assertions/1` parametric object can be used as a hook object to
suppress calls to the `assertion/1-2` predicates using goal-expansion
(the expansion assumes `assertions::assertion/1-2` messages). For example,
assuming the file using assertions is named `source`, it would be compiled
and loaded using the call:

	logtalk_load(source, [hook(assertions(production))])


Redirecting assertion failure messages
--------------------------------------

By default, assertion failures and errors are printed to the standard
output stream. These messages, however, can be intercepted by defining
the `logtalk::message_hook/4` multifile predicate. For example:

	:- category(redirect_assertions_messages).

		:- multifile(logtalk::message_hook/4).
		:- dynamic(logtalk::message_hook/4).

		logtalk::message_hook(Message, error, assertions, _) :-
			writeq(my_log_file, Message), write(my_log_file, '.\n').

	:- end_category.


Converting assertion failures into errors
-----------------------------------------

If you want an assertion failure to result in a failure or a runtime error,
you can intercept the assertion failure messages, optionally still printing
them, and throw an error. For example:

	:- category(assertions_failures_to_errors).

		:- multifile(logtalk::message_hook/4).
		:- dynamic(logtalk::message_hook/4).

		logtalk::message_hook(Message, error, assertions, Tokens) :-
			% uncomment the next two lines to also print the default message
			% logtalk::message_prefix_stream(error, assertions, Prefix, Stream),
			% logtalk::print_message_tokens(Stream, Prefix, Tokens),
			throw(error(Message, _)).

	:- end_category.

In alternative, if you want assertions to always trigger an exception, use
instead the `lgtunit` tool `assertions/1-2` public predicates.
