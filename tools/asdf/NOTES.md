`asdf`
======

A Logtalk plugin for the [asdf](https://asdf-vm.com/#/) extendable version
manager is available at:

https://github.com/LogtalkDotOrg/asdf-logtalk

This plugin provides an alternative to the `logtalk_version_select` script
that can be useful to manage Logtalk versions when developing solutions
that use other languages and tools that can also be handled by `asdf`.
