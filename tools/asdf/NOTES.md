A Logtalk plugin for the `asdf` extendable version manager is available at:

    https://github.com/LogtalkDotOrg/asdf-logtalk

This plugin provides an alternative to the `logtalk_version_select` script
that can be useful to manage Logtalk versions when developing solutions
that use other languages and tools that can also be handled by `asdf`.
