% make sure to compile any files that you want to scan for dead code with
% the required source_data flag turned on:

| ?- set_logtalk_flag(source_data, on).
...


% load the tool:

| ?- logtalk_load(dead_code_scanner(loader)).
...


% run the dead_code_scanner tool unit tests:

| ?- logtalk_load(dead_code_scanner(tester)).
...


% apply the tool to itself:

| ?- dead_code_scanner::library(dead_code_scanner).
...


% load the standard library and scan it for dead code:

| ?- logtalk_load(library(all_loader)).
...

| ?- dead_code_scanner::library(library).
...


% scan a specific entity for dead code:

| ?- dead_code_scanner::entity(logtalk).
...


% get a list of all dead predicates in the built-in core_messages category:

| ?- dead_code_scanner::predicates(core_messages, DeadPredicates).
...


% enumerate, by backtracking, all dead predicates in the built-in logtalk
% object:

| ?- dead_code_scanner::predicate(logtalk, DeadPredicate).
