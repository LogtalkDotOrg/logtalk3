To load this example and for sample queries, please see the `SCRIPT.txt`
file.

This example contains simple wrappers for Prolog profiler tools, requiring
either SICStus Prolog 4 or YAP. The example includes two files:

- `yap_profiler.lgt`
	simple wrapper for the YAP count profiler 
	
- `sicstus_profiler.lgt`
	simple wrapper for the SICStus Prolog 4 profiler

Logtalk also supports the YAP tick profiler (using the latest YAP devel
version) and the SWI-Prolog XPCE profiler (using SWI-Prolog devel 5.11.8
or stable 5.10.2 or later versions). When using the XPCE profiler, you
can avoid profiling the Logtalk compiler (which is invoked e.g. when you
use the `(::)/2` message-sending operator at the top-level) by typing:

	| ?- logtalk << (prolog_statistics:profile(... :: ...)).

Given that `prolog_statistics:profile/1` is a meta-predicate, Logtalk will
compile its argument before calling it. Don't forget, however, to load the
`prolog_statistics` module *before* using or compiling calls to the `profile/1`
predicate by typing:

	| ?- use_module(library(statistics)).

The profiler support makes no attempt to conceal the internal Logtalk
compiler/runtime predicates or the generated predicates that implement
predicate inheritance. Calls to internal compiler and runtime predicates
have functors starting with "$lgt_". Calls to predicates with functors
such as "_def", "_dcl", or "_super", used to implement inheritance, may
be listed when your code uses dynamic binding.
