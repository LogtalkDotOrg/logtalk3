This folder contains sample files for project scaffolding:

- `loader-sample.lgt`  
- `settings-sample.lgt`  
- `tester-sample.lgt`  
- `tests-sample.lgt`  

See the comments in the files themselves for details.

These files can be copied to a new project directory, renamed by
removing the `-sample` sub-string, and then edited to bootstrap
a new project.
