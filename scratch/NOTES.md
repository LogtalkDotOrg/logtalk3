This folder is used as a scratch folder for the temporary files generated
by the Logtalk compiler at startup. If you delete this folder by accident,
it will be recreated the next time you run Logtalk.

You may set the value of the `scratch_directory` flag to this folder if
you want to collect in the same location the Prolog temporary files that
are generated when compiling Logtalk source files (e.g. for embedding).
