% start by loading the port:

| ?- logtalk_load(fcube(loader)).
...


% to run the port tests:

| ?- logtalk_load(fcube(tester')).
...


% for examples see the tesrts.lgt file; e.g.:

| ?- ?- fcube::decide((((a & b) => c) <=> ((a => c) | (b => c))), CounterModel).
Input Formula:
F (((a&b) => c) <=> ((a => c) | (b => c)))

Sign Permanence tried,input formula equivalent to: 
   F (((a&b) => c) <=> ((a => c) | (b => c)));
Left branch of F equiv,Main SWFF: F (((a&b) => c) <=> ((a => c) | (b => c)))

      F (((a&b) => c) => ((a => c) | (b => c)));

         F ((a => c) | (b => c));
         T ((a&b) => c);
 
Main SWFF: F ((a => c) | (b => c))

            F (a => c);
            F (b => c);
            T ((a&b) => c);
 
Main SWFF: T ((a&b) => c)

               T (a => (b => c));
