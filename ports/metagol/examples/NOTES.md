To load this port and for sample queries, please see the `SCRIPT.txt`
file in the main directory.

This folder contains ports of the examples in the original `metagol`
distribution. All examples provide a public `learn/0` predicate (or
`learn1/0`, `learn2/0`, ... predicates) to run them. There's also a
`learn/1` predicate (or `learn1/1`, `learn2/1`, ... predicates) that
is mainly used in the unit tests.
