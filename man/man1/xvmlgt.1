.SH NAME
xvmlgt \- Logtalk integration script for XVM

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B xvmlgt
[\fB-q\fR]
[\fB-g \fIgoal\fR]

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBxvmlgt\fR is a Logtalk integration script for XVM. It automatically loads the XVM adapter file, the Logtalk compiler and runtime, the Logtalk default table of library names and paths, and any existing settings file found on the lookup directories. It uses the \fBxvm\fR executable \fB-f\fR option to load the Logtalk files. It passes any options to the \fBxvm\fR executable; see the XVM documentation for the available options. By default, this script runs XVM using \fBrlwrap\fR if available.

.SH OPTIONS
The two most common options are:
.TP
.B \-q
Silence Logtalk default startup messages and compilation messages by setting the \fBreport\fR flag to \fBwarnings\fR.
.TP
.B \-g
.I goal
Initialization goal, written between double quotes, to be executed after Logtalk startup.

.SH REQUIREMENTS
XVM 9.0.0 or a later version is required. This integration script looks for a \fBxvmpl\fR executable in the system path.
