.SH NAME
cxlgt \- Logtalk integration script for CxProlog

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B cxlgt
[\fB--quiet\fR]
[\fB--goal \fIgoal\fR]

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBcxlgt\fR is a Logtalk integration script for CxProlog. It automatically loads the CxProlog adapter file, the Logtalk compiler and runtime, the Logtalk default table of library names and paths, and any existing settings file found on the lookup directories. It uses the \fBcxprolog\fR executable \fB--script\fR option to load the Logtalk files. It passes any options to the \fBcxprolog\fR executable; see the CxProlog documentation for the available options.

.SH OPTIONS
The two most common options are:
.TP
.B \--quiet
Silence Logtalk default startup messages and compilation messages by setting the \fBreport\fR flag to \fBwarnings\fR.
.TP
.B \--goal
.I goal
Initialization goal, written between double quotes, to be executed after Logtalk startup.
