This folder contains adapter files for Prolog compilers that are no longer
supported. Follows some historical notes for these compilers.


ALS Prolog 3.1

	als.pl

	Only a few tests have been done with this compiler. One known problem: an
	ALS bug in operator handling that make calls like "\+ ::Pred" be 
	interpreted like "::(\+ Pred)" instead of "\+ (::Pred)". A workaround is 
	to replace all occurrences of "\+ ::Pred" by "\+ (::Pred)" and all 
	occurrences of "\+ Obj::Pred" by "\+ (Obj::Pred)". Please report any other 
	problems that you might find. Don't forget to use the cd/1 predicate to 
	set the working directory before loading the library or an example. Consult 
	the file builtins/comp_d10.pro in the ALS Prolog installation directory in 
	order to get the definition of predicate numbervars/3 needed by the Logtalk 
	built-in debugger. Supports smart compilation of source files. Does not 
	support the "altdirs" compiler flag. Support for settings files not tested.


Amzi! Prolog 7.6.1 and later versions

	amzi.pl

	For Amzi! Prolog 7.6.1 and later versions. You need to patch the Logtalk 
	compiler (the "core/core.pl" file) by searching for all calls of 
	':'/2 and wrap them inside call/1 (search for the text "':'(" to locate
	the calls). For better performance, use the Amzi! "acmp" command-line 
	compiler to compile the files "adapters/amzi.pl", "core/core.pl", 
	and "paths/paths.pl" and then load the resulting ".plm" files 
	using the predicate load/1 (you will need to edit the "paths.pl" file 
	by following the instructions on the "paths/NOTES.txt" file).

	You will probably need to increase some of the default values (e.g. the 
	"control" parameter) in the "amzi.cfg" file in order to be able to load 
	some of the libraries or some of the examples.

	One potential problem is that the compiler definition of the compare/3 
	built-in predicate returns the atom == instead of = for identical terms 
	(contrary to every other Prolog compiler!). Search the library files for 
	all calls of the compare/3 predicate and make the necessary changes.
	The built-in sort/2 predicate does not eliminate duplicates, which may 
	result in problems with some of the examples. Don't forget to use the 
	chdir/1 predicate to set the working directory before loading a library 
	or an example. Support for settings files not tested.


Bin-Prolog 8.x~10.x

	bin.pl

	Start BinProlog using "bp -l4". You will need to create project files to 
	workaround the restriction of only one top-level file per interactive 
	session. For instance, the project file for the "metapredicates" example
	will look like (in the Unix version):
	
		:- ['$LOGTALKHOME/adapters/bin.pl'].
		:- ['$LOGTALKHOME/core/core.pl'].
		
		:- ['$LOGTALKUSER/examples/metapredicates/meta.pl'].
		:- ['$LOGTALKUSER/examples/metapredicates/sort1.pl'].
		...
	
	You will probably want to have a project file including only the adapter
	and the pre-processor/runtime files (core.pl) in order to compile the
	examples using logtalk_compile/1-2 (do NOT use logtalk_load/1-2 or the 
	provided loader files). Don't forget to call the cd/1 predicate to set 
	the working directory before compiling the library or an example. 
	Supports smart compilation of source files. Support for settings files 
	not tested.

	Updated and tested with help of Arun Majumdar.


CIAO Prolog 1.13.1

	ciao.pl

	The definition of the predicate '$lgt_predicate_property'/2 in the 
	file "ciao_aux.pl" is a bit of a hack, but should enable you to run 
	the Logtalk companion examples and to try out your own Logtalk 
	programs. 

	Don't forget to call the cd/1 predicate to set the working directory 
	before compiling the library or an example (you will need first to 
	load the library system that exports the cd/1 predicate by calling 
	the goal use_module(library(system)).


ECLiPSe 5.10#26 or later 5.10 versions

	eclipse5.pl
	eclipse5iso.pl

	There are two adapters files for this compiler. The first one, named 
	"eclipse5.pl", should be used when, for some reason, you don't want 
	to load the "iso" library. The second file, "eclipse5iso.pl" contains 
	a call to load the "iso" library. Both adapter files may be used with
	ECLiPSe 5.10#26 or later versions.

	You should use the "eclipse5iso.pl" adapter file whenever possible.
	The "eclipse5.pl" adapter file may not contain all the necessary 
	definitions for ISO Prolog predicates that are needed for compiling 
	Logtalk itself, the Logtalk library, or the Logtalk examples. On the 
	other hand, some of the ECLiPSE features (e.g. array notation or using
	do/2 as an operator in logical loops) are not available when using the
	"iso" library.

	There is a clash between Logtalk and ECLiPSe regarding the ::/2 operator.
	You may still use the ::/2 operator defined on the ECLiPSe constraint 
	solver libraries by using explicit module qualification by writing 
	"{library:(Var::Domain)}" (replace "library" by the actual library name; 
	the {}/1 control construct allows you to bypass the Logtalk compiler).

	For improved performance, add the following calls to the top of all the 
	files in the "compiler" sub-directory:
	
		:- pragma(system).
		:- pragma(nodebug).

	These calls disables debugging support for the Logtalk compiler/runtime 
	Prolog code and mark the Logtalk predicates as built-ins. Make sure that 
	the library top-level is loaded if you want to use the Logtalk built-in 
	debugger.

	Adopted from a adapter file written and tested with help of Taner Bilgic 
	for Logtalk 1.x. Don't forget to use the cd/1 predicate to set the 
	working directory before loading the library or an example. Supports 
	smart compilation of source files.

	With this Prolog compiler, avoid reloading Logtalk source files declaring
	and defining dynamic predicates. Due to the semantics of the ECLiPSe 
	built-in predicate compile/1, new clauses for dynamic predicates are 
	appended to the old ones instead of replacing them.

	Full support for settings files on POSIX operating-systems. On Windows,
	only supports settings files on the Logtalk user folder. Doesn't support
	the "altdirs" flag.


IF/Prolog 5.3 and later versions

	if.pl

	IF/Prolog 5.3 supports the ISO Prolog standard. No problems expected
	but not tested (my email requests for an evaluation version were never
	answered). Don't forget to use the chdir/1 predicate to set the 
	working directory before loading the library or an example. Supports 
	smart compilation of source files. Does not support the "altdirs" 
	compiler flag. Full support for settings files on POSIX operating-
	systems. Support for settings files on Windows unknown.


JIProlog 3.0.2-6 and later versions

	ji.pl

	Written with the help of the JIProlog author (but if you find any Logtalk 
	problem please report it to me). Don't forget to use the cd/1 predicate to 
	set the working directory before loading the library or an example. Some 
	examples may not compile or run due to work in progress regarding ISO 
	Prolog standard compliance. Supports smart compilation of source files.
	Settings files are not supported (must be manually loaded after starting 
	Logtalk).


K-Prolog 5.1.5 and later 5.1.x versions

	k5.pl

	K-Prolog 5.1.5 supports the ISO Prolog standard (except the ISO
	Prolog standard multifile/1 directive, therefore forcing the use of
	the "paths/paths_no_multifile.pl" file). No problems expected. 
	Adapter file written and tested with the help of Nobukuni Kino. Don't 
	forget to use the cd/1 predicate to set the working directory before 
	loading the library or an example. Smart compilation of source files
	is not supported on Windows. Full support for settings files on POSIX
	operating-systems. On Windows, only supports settings files on the 
	Logtalk user folder. Does not support the "altdirs" compiler flag.


K-Prolog 6.0.4 and later versions

	k6.pl

	K-Prolog 6.0.4 supports the current ISO Prolog standard (except the ISO
	Prolog standard multifile/1 directive, therefore forcing the use of the
	"paths/paths_no_multifile.pl" file) and features from the draft
	core revision proposal.

	Don't forget to use the cd/1 predicate to set the working directory
	before loading the library or an example. Smart compilation of source
	files is not supported on Windows. Full support for settings files on
	POSIX operating-systems. On Windows, only supports settings files on
	the Logtalk user folder. Does not support the "altdirs" compiler flag.


LPA MacProlog32 1.25

	lpamac.pl

	This is my old Prolog development environment. Two known problems: (1) an
	LPA bug in operator handling that make calls like "\+ ::Pred" be 
	interpreted like "::(\+ Pred)" instead of "\+ (::Pred)". A workaround is 
	to replace all occurrences of "\+ ::Pred" by "\+ (::Pred)"; (2) If you call
	the \+ operator in your code the writeq/1 built-in don't always output a 
	space after the operator resulting in calls like "\+(...)". Because \+ is 
	not defined as a predicate this will fail. Don't forget to use the dvol/1 
	predicate to set the working directory before loading an example.
	Due to the size of the Logtalk pre-processor file, you must load it by 
	using the consult/1 predicate instead of using the File:Open menu option.
	Be aware that this adapter file redefines some built-ins that
	you may use in your own programs. You must be careful to not consult the 
	adapter file twice. Supports smart compilation of source files. Does not 
	support the "altdirs" compiler flag. Settings files are not supported 
	(must be manually loaded after starting Logtalk).


LPA WinProlog32 4.0x

	lpawin.pl

	Written with the help of the LPA support team. Of course, if you find
	any bugs please direct your flames to me ;-). Be aware that this adapter
	file redefines some built-ins that you may use in your programs. Don't 
	forget to use the chdir/1 predicate to set the working directory before 
	loading the library or an example. Be careful to not consult the adapter 
	file twice. Supports smart compilation of source files. Does not support 
	the "altdirs" compiler flag. Settings files are not supported (must be 
	manually loaded).


MasterProlog 4.1

	master.pl

	Written with the help of the MasterProlog support team (but if you find 
	any Logtalk problem please report it to me). 
	If in the MasterProlog version that you are using the implementation of 
	the close/1 predicate does not follow the ISO standard, you will have to
	apply the following patch to the Logtalk pre-processor: replace every 
	call of close(...) with fclose(...).  Does not support the "altdirs" 
	compiler flag. Support for settings files not tested.


Open Prolog 1.1b5

	open.pl

	Limited test done. Please report any problems that you may find.
	Don't forget to use the set_folder/1 predicate to set the working 
	directory before loading the library or an example. Does not support 
	the "altdirs" compiler flag. Settings files are not supported (must 
	be manually loaded).


PrologII+ 4.5 and later versions

	prologII.pl

	Written and tested with the help of Claude Lai from PrologIA. You need
	to apply the following patches to the Logtalk pre-processor/runtime:
	Search and replace every instance of "quoted(true)" with "quoted(:true)";
	"open(File, write, Stream)" with "open(File, :write, Stream)",
	"catch(close(Stream), _, true)" with "catch(close(Stream), _, :true)",
	"open(File, read, Stream)" with "open(File, :read, Stream, [eof_action(eof_code)])".
	Remember that you need to use the set_import_dir/1 built-in predicate to
	set the working directory before loading the library or an example.
	Does not support the "altdirs" compiler flag. Settings files are not 
	supported (must be manually loaded after starting Logtalk).


Quintus Prolog 3.3~3.5

	quintus.pl

	Written and tested with help of a friend of mine, Paulo Urbano, for a 
	previous version. Adopted for the current release using the Windows 
	version for testing. You must patch the Logtalk compiler due to the 
	different argument order of the built-in predicates read_term/3 and 
	open/4: for all calls of both predicates, exchange the last two 
	arguments (these patches render Logtalk incompatible with all the
	other compilers). Don't forget to use the unix(cd(Dir)) predicate to
	set the working directory before loading the library or an example.
	Supports smart compilation of source files. Settings files are not
	supported (must be manually loaded after starting Logtalk).
