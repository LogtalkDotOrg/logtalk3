% start by loading the example:

| ?- logtalk_load(bench(loader)).
...


% run all tests, repeating each one 1000 times:

| ?- run.
...

% run all tests, repeating each one N times, e.g. 2000 times:

| ?- run(2000).
...

% run a specific benchmark, e.g. "nreverse", 10000 times:

| ?- run(nreverse, 10000).
...


% if you want to compare Logtalk and plain Prolog versions of an individual
% benchmark, load also its Prolog file (in this case, you must quit and
% restart Logtalk for each testing scenario); for example:

| ?- ['$LOGTALKUSER/examples/bench/boyer.pl'].
yes


% you can also use the "lgtunit" tool benchmark predicates directly; for
% example:

| ?- lgtunit::benchmark(boyer::top,1000,Time).
Time = ...
yes

% for accurate timings of compiled ::/2 goals, the lgtunit::benchmark/3
% calls should be made from compiled code in order to avoid the top-level
% interpretation of the goals; an handy alternative is to use:

| ?- logtalk<<(lgtunit::benchmark(boyer::top,1000,Time)).
Time = ...
yes


% some Prolog compilers such as SWI-Prolog and YAP provide a handy time/1
% predicate that may also be used in alternative to the `lgtunit` benchmark
% predicates (the adapter files for these two systems ensure that ::/2 goals
% in the argument of the time/1 are fully compiled prior to calling them so
% that we benchmark the code instead of the Logtalk compiler):

| ?- time(true).  % autoload if necessary
...

| ?- time((between(1,1000,_),top,fail;true)).
...

| ?- time((between(1,1000,_),boyer::top,fail;true)).
...
