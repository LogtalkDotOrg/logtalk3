To load this example and for sample queries, please see the `SCRIPT.txt`
file. This example is only supported when using SWI-Prolog or YAP as the
backend compiler.

This is a simple example of using a Java library for performing clustering
of a set of numbers. It uses the Apache Commons Math Java library, which
you **must** download from:

http://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-math/download_math.cgi

After downloading the library archive, decompress it, and copy the main
JAR (for version 3.6.1, this would be the `commons-math3-3.6.1.jar` file)
to the example `jars` folder before running the example.
