% be sure to have download the required JAR files before attempting to
% run this example; see the `NOTES.txt` file for details

% start by setting the Java CLASSPATH environment variable; three backend
% Prolog systems are supported (LVM, SWI-Prolog, and YAP) and for each one
% there's a Bash script file that sets the CLASSPATH environment variable
% when sourced; for example, when using SWI-Prolog:

$ cd "$LOGTALKUSER/examples/clustering"
$ . set_classpath_swi.sh


% second, start Logtalk and load the example:

| ?- logtalk_load(clustering(loader)).
...


% create 4 clusters from a list of float values:

| ?- clustering::clusters([1.0,1.5,1.8,3.5,3.6,4.0,4.2], 4, 10000, Clusters).
Clusters = [[3.5, 3.6], [1.5, 1.8], [4.0, 4.2], [1.0]].
