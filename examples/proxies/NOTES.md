A parametric object may be used to represent objects whose "state" is static 
and set when the object is defined. However, there can be only one parametric 
object with a given functor and arity. For example, if we define the following
parametric object:

	:- object(circle(_Radius, _Color)).
		...
	:- end_object.

then the following terms may be interpreted as references to the object above:

	circle(1, blue)
	circle(2, yellow)

In the context of parametric objects, the above terms are known as "parametric
object proxies". Proxies represent different instantiations of a parametric 
object parameters. Proxy terms may be stored on the database as Prolog facts 
or as Prolog rules (parameter instantiation can be deduced instead of being 
fixed). This results in a very compact representation, which can be an 
advantage when dealing with a large number of objects with immutable state. 
In addition, all the predicates managing these compact representation are 
encapsulated in a parametric object. This can be, however, a fragile solution 
as changes on the parametric object ancestors may imply changes to the number 
and meaning of the parametric object parameters which, in turn, may imply 
changes to all the Prolog facts used to represent the individual objects.

Note that parametric objects can co-exist with "normal" objects. For example, 
when using a class-based design, we may use "normal" instances together with
a parametric instance of the same class.
