% be sure to have installed Neo4j; see the `NOTES.txt` file for details


% start by setting the Java CLASSPATH environment variable; three backend
% Prolog systems are supported (LVM, SWI-Prolog, and YAP) and for each one
% there's a Bash script file that sets the CLASSPATH environment variable
% when sourced; for example, when using SWI-Prolog (if necessary, edit the
% scripts for the location of the Neo4j JAR files):

$ cd "$LOGTALKUSER/examples/neo4j"
$ . set_classpath_swi.sh


% second, start Logtalk and load the example:

| ?- logtalk_load(neo4j(loader)).
...


% print a greeting message:

| ?- hello_world('bolt://localhost:7687', 'neo4j', 'password')::print_greeting('Hello world!').

Hello world!, from node 0
yes


% find the people Neo knows in the Matrix:

| ?- matrix('bolt://localhost:7687', 'neo4j', 'password')::neo_knows(Who).

Who =  = ['Agent Smith', 'Cypher', 'Morpheus', 'Trinity']
yes
