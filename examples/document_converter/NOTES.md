To load this example and for sample queries, please see the `SCRIPT.txt`
file. This example is only supported when using LVM (with its `jni` plug-in
installed), SWI-Prolog, or YAP as the backend compiler.

This is a simple example of using a Java library for converting documents
to text using the Apache Tika Java library, which you **must** download
from:

https://tika.apache.org

After downloading the Tika JAR file (for version 2.7.0, this would be the
`tika-app-2.7.0.jar` file), copy it to the example `jars` folder before
running the example.
