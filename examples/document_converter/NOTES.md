To load this example and for sample queries, please see the `SCRIPT.txt`
file. This example is only supported when using SWI-Prolog or YAP as the
backend compiler.

This is a simple example of using a Java library for converting documents
to text using the Apache Tika Java library, which you **must** download
from:

https://tika.apache.org

After downloading the Tika JAR file (for version 1.19.1, this would be
the `tika-app-1.19.1.jar` file), copy it to the example `jars` folder
before running the example.
