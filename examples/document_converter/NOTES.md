# document_converter

This example is only supported when using XVM (with its `jni` plug-in
installed), SWI-Prolog, or YAP as the backend compiler.

This is a simple example of using a Java library for converting documents
to text using the Apache Tika Java library, which you **must** download
from:

https://tika.apache.org

After downloading the Tika JAR file (for version 2.8.0, this would be the
`tika-app-2.8.0.jar` file), copy it to this example `jars` folder before
running the example.

Be sure to have download the required JAR files before attempting to
run this example.

When running this example from the terminal (i.e., not as a notebook),
start by setting the Java `CLASSPATH` environment variable. Three backend
Prolog systems are supported: XVM, SWI-Prolog, and YAP. There's a Bash
script file that sets the `CLASSPATH` environment variable when sourced:

```text
$ cd "$LOGTALKUSER/examples/document_converter"
$ . set_classpath.sh
```

Similar for Windows using the `set_classpath.ps1` PowerShell script.

Print Logtalk, Prolog backend, and kernel versions (if running as a notebook):

```logtalk
%versions
```

Set the required environment variables (edit if using a different Apache Tika version):

```logtalk
setenv('CLASSPATH', './jars/tika-app-2.8.0.jar'), setenv('TIKA_CONFIG', './jars/tika-config.xml').
```

Load the example:

```logtalk
logtalk_load(document_converter(loader)).
```

Convert a `sample.pdf` document to a `sample.txt` file:

```logtalk
document::convert('test_files/sample.pdf', 'test_files/sample.txt').
```

<!--
true.
-->

Get the text contents of a `sample.pdf` document:

```logtalk
document::contents('test_files/sample.pdf', Contents).
```

<!--
Contents = ... .
-->
