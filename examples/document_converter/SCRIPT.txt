% start by setting the Java CLASSPATH environment variable; three backend
% Prolog systems are supported (XVM, SWI-Prolog, and YAP) and for each one
% there's a Bash script file that sets the CLASSPATH environment variable
% when sourced; for example, when using SWI-Prolog:

$ cd "$LOGTALKUSER/examples/document_converter"
$ . set_classpath_swi.sh


% second, start Logtalk and load the example:

| ?- logtalk_load(document_converter(loader)).
...


% convert a "sample.pdf" document to a "sample.txt" file:

| ?- document::convert('sample.pdf', 'sample.txt').

% get the text contents of a "sample.pdf" document:
