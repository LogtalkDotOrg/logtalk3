% start by loading the example:

| ?- logtalk_load(roles(loader)).
...


% prototypes can declare and defined their own predicates:

| ?- prototype::foo(Foo).

Foo = 1
yes


% derived prototypes inherit predicates from their parents:

| ?- descendant::foo(Foo).

Foo = 2 
yes

| ?- descendant::bar(X, Y).

X = 1,
Y = 2
yes


% a class that is its own metaclass can access its own predicates:

| ?- class::foo(Foo).

Foo = 1
yes


% a subclass that doesn't have a metaclass cannot receive any message:

| ?- subclass::current_predicate(_).

no


% an instance can receive messages for predicates declared in its
% class(es) and in its class(es) superclass(es):

| ?- instance::current_predicate(P).

P = bar/2 ;
P = foo/1
yes

| ?- instance::foo(Foo).

Foo = 2
yes

| ?- instance::bar(X, Y).

X = 1,
Y = 2
yes
