% an object with no instantiation or specialization relation with another
% object plays the role of a prototype:

:- object(prototype).

	:- public(foo/1).
	foo(1).

:- end_object.


% prototypes can be derived from other prototypes using the "extends"
% relation; the prototypes that are extended play the role of parent
% prototypes:

:- object(parent).

	:- public(foo/1).
	foo(1).

:- end_object.


:- object(descendant,
	extends(parent)).

	:- public(bar/2).
	bar(1,2).

	foo(2).

:- end_object.


% to define objects playing the role of classes and/or instances, an
% object must have at least an instantiation or a specialization
% relation with another object

% a class can be its own metaclass (thus preventing infinite regression):

:- object(superclass,
	instantiates(superclass)).

	:- public(foo/1).
	foo(1).

:- end_object.

% a subclass is role a that an object plays when it specializes another
% object, which plays the role of its superclass:

:- object(subclass,
	specializes(superclass)).

	:- public(bar/2).
	bar(1,2).

:- end_object.

% an object that instantiates another object plays the role of an
% instance while the instantiated object plays the role of its class:

:- object(instance,
	instantiates(subclass)).

	foo(2).

:- end_object.

:- object(empty_instance,
	instantiates(subclass)).

:- end_object.
