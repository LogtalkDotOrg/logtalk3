This folder contains several examples of multi-threading programming.
Multi-threading programming is only supported on some Prolog compilers.
Currently this includes SWI-Prolog, YAP, and some XSB versions (make sure
that you use the multi-threading versions of these Prolog compilers!). 
Moreover, multi-threading may be turned off by default. In order to run 
the examples,  you may need to first turn on multi-threading support on
the Prolog adapter files.

Some examples try to benchmark single-threaded and multi-threaded solutions.
Depending on the Prolog compiler, the operating-system, and the computer
used, you may need to adjust the size of the problem data in order to find
the threshold where multi-threading solutions begin to outperform the
single-threaded solutions.

Some examples may imply adjusting the default size of thread data areas or,
preferably, use of the 64 bits version of the compatible Prolog compilers.

There are known Prolog bugs on the multi-threading support found on XSB 
and YAP. These bugs prevent some examples to run and may lead to crashes.
Some bugs are platform-specific, only occurring on some operating-systems.
