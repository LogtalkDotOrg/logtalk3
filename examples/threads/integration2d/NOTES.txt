This folder contains a multi-threading implementation of Recursive Gaussian 
Quadrature Methods for Numerical Integration for functions of two variables.

Adaptive quadrature methods are efficient numerical integration techniques
as they compensate for functional variation along the integral domain. This
is accomplished by using a larger sampling of points in regions with large 
function variations.

Two objects, "quadrec2d" and "quadsplit2d", implement two versions of the 
quadrature methods.

In the quadrec2d object, the multi-threading method used is to divide 
the integral volume amongst the number of threads used (a power of 4) and 
then recursively apply the same method in each interval. The implementation 
uses the threaded/1 Logtalk built-in predicate.

In the quadsplit2d object, a divide and conquer approach is also used but 
the original domain is split along a single dimension. A thread is spawned 
for each sub-interval. This method can use any number of threads. However, 
by splitting along a single dimension, this method may perform poorly for 
functions where the splitting leaves must of work to just a few threads 
(resulting in load balancing problems).

The split/spawn/collect of thread goals uses the Logtalk built-in predicates 
threaded_once/1 and threaded_exit/1.

Both objects implement the same protocol:

    integrate(Function, A, B, C, D, NP, Error, Integral)

This predicate allows us to find the integral of a function of two variables 
on the rectangular domain [A,B][C,D] given a maximum approximation error.
NP represents the method to be used (0,1,2,3). For NP = 0, an adaptive 
trapezoidal rule is used. For NP = 1, 2, 3 an adaptive gaussian quadrature of
1, 2, or 3 points is used.
