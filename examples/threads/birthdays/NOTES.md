# threads - birthdays

This folder contains a simple multi-threading example with agents and
their birthdays, illustrating the use of the built-in predicates
`threaded_ignore/1`, `threaded_once/1`, and `threaded_exit/1`.

When using XVM as the backend, this example must be run from the top-level
interpreter.

Print Logtalk, Prolog backend, and kernel versions (if running as a notebook):

```logtalk
%versions
```

Load the example:

```logtalk
logtalk_load(birthdays(loader)).
```

Create two new agents, Paul and Nathalie:

```logtalk
agent::(new(paul, 40, male), new(nathalie, 32, female)).
```

<!--
true.
-->

Make them friends:

```logtalk
paul::new_friend(nathalie).
```

<!--
true.
-->

Turn event support on for messages sent at the command-line
(i.e., for messages sent from the pseudo-object `user`):

```logtalk
set_logtalk_flag(events, allow).
```

<!--
true.
-->

It's birthday for Nathalie:

```logtalk
nathalie::birthday.
```

<!--
Happy birthday from paul!
Thanks! Here, have a slice of cake, paul.
Thanks for the cake nathalie!
Say goodbye to your 32's!

true.
-->

Ask Nathalie her age:

```logtalk
nathalie::age(Age).
```

<!--
Age = 33.
-->

A year goes by...

```logtalk
nathalie::birthday.
```

<!--
Happy birthday from paul!
Thanks! Here, have a slice of cake, paul.
Thanks for the cake nathalie!
Say goodbye to your 33's!

true.
-->

Turn event support off:

```logtalk
set_logtalk_flag(events, deny).
```

<!--
true.
-->
