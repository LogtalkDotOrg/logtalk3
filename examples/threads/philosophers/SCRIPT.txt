% same problem as above but using a parametric object for representing the philosophers:

| ?- threaded_ignore(philosopher(p1,cs1,cs2)::run(5, 5)), threaded_ignore(philosopher(p2,cs2,cs3)::run(5, 5)), threaded_ignore(philosopher(p3,cs3,cs4)::run(5, 5)), threaded_ignore(philosopher(p4,cs4,cs5)::run(5, 5)), threaded_ignore(philosopher(p5,cs1,cs5)::run(5, 5)).
