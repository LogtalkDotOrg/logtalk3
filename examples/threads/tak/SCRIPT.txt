% load the example:

% NOTE: the example queries below use a SWI-Prolog proprietary predicate 
% time/1 in order to get accurate goal times. This predicate is also found 
% on recent development versions of YAP and XSB. For other Prolog compilers, 
% replace the time/1 call by any appropriate timing calls (e.g. cputime/0).


% single-threaded version:

| ?- time(tak(1)::tak(18, 12, 6, R)).
% 254,476 inferences, 0.06 CPU in 0.07 seconds (91% CPU, 4241267 Lips)

R = 7
yes

| ?- time(tak(3)::tak(18, 12, 6, R)).
% 714 inferences, 0.06 CPU in 0.05 seconds (121% CPU, 11900 Lips)
