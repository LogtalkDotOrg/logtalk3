To load this example and for sample queries, please see the `SCRIPT.txt` file.

This example requires support for both threads and coroutining. Currently it
runs on ECLiPSe and SWI-Prolog. It should run also on XSB and YAP if and when
these systems bugs with coroutining and/or threads get fixed.

This folder contains examples of fluents implemented using threaded engines.
Fluents are described in the paper:
