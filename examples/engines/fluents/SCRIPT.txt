% load the example:

| ?- logtalk_load(fluents(loader)).
...


% get answers from the fluent:

| ?- fluents::next(N1).
N1 = 1
yes

| ?- fluents::next(N2).
N2 = 2
yes

| ?- fluents::next(N3).
N3 = 3
yes

% after exhausting the fluent answers, subsequent queries fail
% until the threaded engine implementing the fluent is destroyed:

| ?- fluents::next(_).
no

| ?- fluents::next(_).
no
