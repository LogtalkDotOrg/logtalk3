% load the example:

...


% some clauses for a predicate used in the next queries:

| ?- assertz(a(2)), assertz(a(1)), assertz(a(4)), assertz(a(3)).
yes


% find the larger value from the values returned by a generator:

| ?- emetas::best_of(X, (>), a(X)).
X = 4
yes


% test the threaded engine implementation of the standard findall/3 meta-predicate:

| ?- emetas::find_all(X, a(X), List).
List = [2, 1, 4, 3]
yes


% test the threaded engine implementation of the find_at_most/4 meta-predicate:

| ?- emetas::find_at_most(3, X, a(X), Xs).
Xs = [2, 1, 4]
yes

| ?- emetas::find_at_most(7, X, a(X), Xs).
Xs = [2, 1, 4, 3]
