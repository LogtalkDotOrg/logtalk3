This folder contains examples of using Logtalk support for lambda
expressions. Some examples and test queries are collected from public
discussions on lambda expressions on the SWI-Prolog mailing list and
on the `comp.lang.prolog` discussion group.

The `lambda_warnings` file illustrates lint checks for lambda expressions.
