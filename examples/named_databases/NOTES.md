file.

This example implements "named databases", providing a prototype implementation
for a *portable* API based on Lean Prolog implementation of this functionality.
The goal is to provide the fastest possible *loading time* for encapsulated
data. The API supports loading data from a file into a named database, saving
a named database to a file, together with a set of predicates derived from the
standard Prolog built-in database predicates. The performance advantage of
using a Prolog module over a Logtalk object is that, for the supported backend
compilers, the module file is compiled in one step without requiring generating
and compiling an intermediate file as (must be) done by the Logtalk compiler
when loading a source file (for portability across compiler backends).

Named databases are currently implemented for a subset of the Prolog systems
supported by Logtalk: ECLiPSe, SICStus Prolog, SWI-Prolog, and YAP.

Caveat: most Prolog systems cannot list clauses for static code. Some systems,
such as SWI-Prolog, do allow listing of static code by default but can be set
to prevent it. One important consequence is that, although it is possible to
*load* files with static predicates into named databases, saving them will
only save the dynamic predicates. I.e. named databases loading static resources
should be regarded as read-only databases.

A hook object is provided for optimizing calls to the named database API
predicates within object and categories.

Being a programming example, there isn't currently any error checking on
the API predicate arguments.
