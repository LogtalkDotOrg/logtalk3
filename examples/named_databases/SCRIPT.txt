% start by loading the example:

| ?- logtalk_load(named_databases(loader)).
...


% create a new named database:

| ?- db_create(my_db).
yes


% add some facts to the new database:

| ?- db_dynamic(my_db, foo/1).
yes

| ?- db_assertz(my_db, foo(1)), db_assertz(my_db, foo(2)), db_assertz(my_db, foo(3)).
yes


% prove goals using the named database:

| ?- db_call(my_db, foo(X)).
X = 1 ;
X = 2 ;
X = 3
yes

| ?- db_once(my_db, foo(X)).
X = 1
yes


% save all dynamic predicates in the database to a file:

| ?- db_save(my_db, 'my_db.pl').
yes


% clear the named database:

| ?- db_clear(my_db).
yes


% load the saved file into a different database:

| ?- db_create(foo_db), db_load(foo_db, 'my_db.pl').
yes


% check that the saved facts are there by retracting them one by one:

| ?- db_retract(foo_db, foo(X)).
X = 1 ;
X = 2 ;
X = 3
yes
