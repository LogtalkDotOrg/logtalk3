To load this example and for sample queries, please see the `SCRIPT.txt`
file.

This is a very simple example of the use of events and monitors to make 
profilers for an application. It's easy to modify to make it do much more. 
For instance, most Prolog compilers give you access to data concerning
space usage (stacks, heap, etc).

The example defines three objects:

- `message_counter`  
	using events, this object allows us to count the messages sent to
	spied objects 

- `stop_watch`  
	using events, this object simply prints the CPU time before and
	after a message sent to a spied object

- `timer`  
	this object implements a method that sends a message to an object
	a specified number of times, returning the average execution time
