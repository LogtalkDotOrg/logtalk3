To load this example and for sample queries, please see the `SCRIPT.txt`
file.

This example illustrates how to use the optional terms library to decouple
data acquisition, which must be able to represent optional values in the
data, from data processing, which decides how to handle those values and
their absence. The use of optionals terms avoids the often problematic
solution of using special values to represent the absence of optionals
values. The optional terms library predicates allow handling the optional
terms without the need to use if-then-else or cut control constructs.

For a description of this example, please see the comments in the 
`books.lgt` source file.
