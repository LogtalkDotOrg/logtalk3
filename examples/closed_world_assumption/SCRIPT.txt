% start by loading the example (by default, it will generate a number of
% warnings, which are expected):

| ?- logtalk_load(closed_world_assumption(loader)).
...


% attic/0 is a public predicate, defined to be true:

| ?- house::attic.
yes


% cellar/0 is also a public predicate but without a definition; the
message will fail per closed world assumption:

| ?- house::cellar.
no


% no pool/0 predicate declared; closed world assumption doesn't apply
% and thus the message generates an error:

| ?- house::pool.
ERROR: error(existence_error(predicate_declaration,pool/0)


% our house is pleasant as we have a porch and a garden:

| ?- house::pleasant.
yes


% but our house is not practical as we don't have a shed for the garden
% tools or a garage to protect our bikes (per closed world assumption,
% calling declared by undefined predicates fail):

| ?- house::practical.
no


% no idea if we live in a fun house, however, as calling a undeclared and
% undefined predicate generates an error; the closed world assumption
% doesn't apply in this case:

| ?- house::fun.
ERROR: error(existence_error(procedure,pool/0), _)
