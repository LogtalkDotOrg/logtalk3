% start by loading the example:

| ?- logtalk_load(questions(loader)).
...


% we can now ask the ultimate question:

| ?- logtalk::ask_question(question, hitchhikers, ultimate_answer, '=='(42), N).

The answer to the ultimate question of life, the universe and everything is?
> 42.

N = 42
yes


% note that the fourth argument of the logtalk::ask_question/5 predicate is
% a closure that is used to type-check the answer:

| ?- logtalk::ask_question(question, hitchhikers, ultimate_answer, '=='(42), N).
The answer to the ultimate question of life, the universe and everything is?
> icecream.
> tea.
> 42.

N = 42
yes


% if running using JIProlog, SWI-Prolog, or YAP as the backend, try asking the
% question after the goal:

| ?- logtalk_load(questions(loader_gui)).
...
