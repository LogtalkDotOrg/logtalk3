# inlining

For a description of this example, please see the comments in the
`inlining.lgt` source file.

Print Logtalk, Prolog backend, and kernel versions (if running as a notebook):

```logtalk
%versions
```

Start by loading the example:

```logtalk
logtalk_load(inlining(loader)).
```

Confirm that the `between/3` predicate is inlined:

```logtalk
inlining::predicate_property(a(_,_), inline).
```

<!--
true.
-->

List all definition properties of the inlined `a/2` predicate:

```logtalk
object_property(inlining, defines(a/2, Properties)).
```

<!--
Properties = [..., inline, ...].
-->
