% categories are fine-grained units of code reuse
% that can be imported by any number of objects

:- category(ctg).

	:- public([
		get_default/1, set_default/1,
		get_value/1, set_value/1
	]).

	% categories can declare and handle dynamic
	% predicates but cannot contain clauses for them
	:- private(state/1).
	:- dynamic(state/1).

	get_default(State) :-
		% call state/1 in the context of "this"
		state(State).

	set_default(State) :-
		% retract clause in "this"
		retractall(state(_)),
		% assert clause in "this"
		assertz(state(State)).

	get_value(State) :-
		% call state/1 in the context of "self"
		::state(State).

	set_value(State) :-
		% retract all clauses in "self"
		::retractall(state(_)),
		% assert clause in "self"
		::assertz(state(State)).

:- end_category.


% category predicates are inherited by the descendants
% of the objects importing the category

:- object(top,
	imports(ctg)).

:- end_object.


:- object(middle,
	extends(top)).

:- end_object.


:- object(bottom,
	extends(middle)).

:- end_object.
