To load this example and for sample queries, please see the `SCRIPT.txt`
file.

This folder contains an example that shows how to use a complementing
category to patch broken object predicate declarations and definitions 
(without modifying its source code), thus providing functionality similar
to Objective-C categories.

The complemented objects must be compiled with the flag `complements` set
to `allow` (its default value is usually `deny`). This solution was adapted
to improve performance of applications that don't make use complementing
categories and to provide a solution for preventing the use of categories
to break object encapsulation. Note that the `complements` flag can be set
on a per-object basis by using the `set_logtalk_flag/2` directive.
