To load this example and for sample queries, please see the `SCRIPT.txt`
file.

This folder contains several examples of using Prolog built-in meta-predicates
and module meta-predicates that take closures as arguments. It is used to help
test the Logtalk support for dealing with closures as it requires generation of
a helper predicate per call to workaround a clash between the way Logtalk
compiles predicates and the way a closure is extended to form a goal.

This example supports using ECLiPSe, GNU Prolog, SICStus Prolog, SWI-Prolog,
and YAP as the backend compilers.
