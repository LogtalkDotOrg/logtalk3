# symbiosis

This folder contains several examples of using Prolog built-in meta-predicates
and module meta-predicates that take closures as arguments. It is used to help
test the Logtalk support for dealing with closures as it requires generation of
a helper predicate per call to workaround a clash between the way Logtalk
compiles predicates and the way a closure is extended to form a goal.

This example supports using ECLiPSe, GNU Prolog, SICStus Prolog, SWI-Prolog,
Trella Prolog, and YAP as the backend compilers.

Start by loading the example:

```logtalk
logtalk_load(symbiosis(loader)).
```

Using the Prolog backend `maplist/2` predicate to check a list of integers:

```logtalk
symbiosis::p.
```

<!--
true.
-->

Using the Prolog backend `maplist/3` predicate to convert characters into codes:

```logtalk
symbiosis::q(L).
```

<!--
L = [97, 98, 99].
-->

Sorting lists of lists using the Prolog backend `maplist/3` predicate:

```logtalk
symbiosis::r(L).
```

<!--
L = [1, 2, 3].
-->

Adding one to each integer in a list using maplist/3 with a lambda expression with a built-in predicate:

```logtalk
symbiosis::s(L).
```

<!--
L = [2,3,4].
-->

Adding one to each integer in a list using maplist/3 with a lambda expression with a local predicate:

```logtalk
symbiosis::t(L).
```

<!--
L = [2,3,4].
-->
