# complements (allow)

This folder contains an example that show how to use both static and dynamic
categories to explicitly complement an existing object compiled with the
`complements` flag set to `allow`. With this setting, a category can both
redefine and add new functionality to the complemented object.

Start by loading the non-patched `employee` object:

```logtalk
logtalk_load(complements_allow(employee)).
```

Ask the `employee` object its name:

```logtalk
employee::name(Name).
```

<!--
Name = john.
-->

Ask the `employee` object its salary:

```logtalk
employee::salary(Salary).
```

<!--
Salary = 23500.
-->

Check the protocol of the `employee` object:

```logtalk
findall(Predicate, employee::current_predicate(Predicate), Predicates).
```

<!--
Predicates = [age/1, name/1, salary/1].
-->

Now load the `add_on` complementing category:

```logtalk
logtalk_load(complements_allow(add_on)).
```

Load the `dynamic.lgt` source file that creates a dynamic complementing
category, also patching the `employee` object:

```logtalk
logtalk_load(complements_allow(dynamic)).
```

Find categories that complement objects:

```logtalk
%%table
complements_object(Category, Object).
```

<!--
Category = dynamic_patch, Object = employee ;
Category = add_on, Object = employee ;
false.
-->

Use the event handler defined in the `add_on` category for the `employee` object:

```logtalk
employee::name(Name).
```

<!--
Received message name(_16) from user
Name = john.
-->

Check the consequences of the runtime patch of the `salary/1` predicate:

```logtalk
employee::salary(Salary).
```

<!--
Received message salary(_G192) from user
Salary = 42000.
-->

Check the new protocol of the `employee` object:

```logtalk
employee::predicates(Predicates).
```

<!--
Received message predicates(_G180) from user

Predicates = [after/3, age/1, before/3, income/1, name/1, predicates/1, salary/1].
-->

List the properties of the `predicates/1` predicate:

```logtalk
%%table
employee::predicate_property(predicates(_), Property).
```

<!--
Property = logtalk ;
Property = scope(public) ;
Property = (public) ;
Property = static ;
Property = declared_in(add_on) ;
Property = declared_in(add_on, 29) ;
Property = defined_in(add_on) ;
Property = defined_in(add_on, 31) ;
Property = number_of_clauses(1).
-->

List the properties of the `income/1` predicate:

```logtalk
%%table
employee::predicate_property(income(_), Property).
```

<!--
Property = logtalk ;
Property = scope(public) ;
Property = (public) ;
Property = static ;
Property = declared_in(employee) ;
Property = alias_of(salary(_G3724)) ;
Property = defined_in(dynamic_patch) ;
Property = number_of_clauses(0).
-->

Later, the boss finds out about the employee hacked salary:

```logtalk
abolish_category(dynamic_patch).
```

<!--
true.
-->

The employee salary is thus back to its original value:

```logtalk
employee::salary(Salary).
```

<!--
Received message salary(_G192) from user
Salary = 23500.
-->
