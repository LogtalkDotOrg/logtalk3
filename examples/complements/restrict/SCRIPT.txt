% start by loading the non-patched vault objects:

| ?- logtalk_load(complements_restrict(vaults)).
...


%  open the "my_vault" vault using the correct password:

| ?- my_vault::open('!"#$%&/()=').
yes


% any other password will be rejected; for example:

| ?- my_vault::open('abc123').
no


% now load the "hacker" complementing category:

| ?- logtalk_load(complements_restrict(hacker)).
...


% try the hacker replaced password and fail miserably:

| ?- my_vault::open('1234567890').
You have been hacked by SmartPants!
no


% the correct, original, password is still the only one capable
% of opening the vault, despite the hacker messages:

| ?- my_vault::open('!"#$%&/()=').
You have been hacked by SmartPants!
yes
