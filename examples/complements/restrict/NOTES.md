# complements (restrict)

This folder contains an example that show how to use a category to
explicitly complement an existing object compiled with the `complements`
flag set to `restrict`. With this setting, a category can only add new
functionality to the complemented object.

Start by loading the non-patched vault objects:

```logtalk
logtalk_load(complements_restrict(vaults)).
```

Open the `my_vault` vault using the correct password:

```logtalk
my_vault::open('!"#$%&/()=').
```

Any other password will be rejected. For example:

```logtalk
my_vault::open('abc123').

<!--
false.
-->

Now load the `hacker` complementing category:

```logtalk
logtalk_load(complements_restrict(hacker)).
...


Try the hacker replaced password and fail miserably:

```logtalk
my_vault::open('1234567890').
```

<!--

false.
-->


The correct, original, password is still the only one capable
of opening the vault, despite the hacker messages:

```logtalk
my_vault::open('!"#$%&/()=').
```

<!--
You have been hacked by SmartPants!
true.
-->
