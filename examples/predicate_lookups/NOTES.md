file.

This example illustrates the predicate declaration and predicate definition
lookup algorithms used when sending a message to an object. For full details,
see the Handbook section on inheritance.

The lookup algorithms differ for instances and for prototypes and also depend
if the lookup is for a predicate declaration or for a predicate definition.
Sending a message to an object, requires two predicate lookups (performed at
compile-time, when possible):

- Lookup the predicate declaration to check that the predicate in within
the scope of the *sender*. In the most common cases, this means that the
predicate is declared public.

- Assuming that the predicate exists and is within scope, lookup the
predicate definition to answer the message. If none found, the message
simply fails as per the Closed World Assumption (CWA).

See the comments in the `prototypes.lgt` and `classes.lgt` source files
and the sample queries in the `SCRIPT.txt` file for further details.
