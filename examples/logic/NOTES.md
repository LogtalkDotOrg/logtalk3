This folder contains an object which implements a translator from 
first-order predicate logic propositions to conjunctive normal form 
and to clausal form. The translator code is partially based on code 
published in the book "Programming in Prolog" by W. F. Clocksin and 
C. S. Mellish.

The following operators are used for representing logic connectives:

- negation: `~`
- disjunction: `v`
- conjunction: `&`
- implication: `=>`
- equivalence: `<=>`

Quantifiers are represented using the following notation:

- universal: `all(X, P)`
- existential: `exists(X, P)`

The two main object predicates are `translate/2` and `step_by_step/2`.
The first predicate, `translate/2`, translate a logic proposition to 
a list of clauses. The second predicate, `step_by_step/2`, performs 
the same translations as `translate/2` but also prints the results 
of each conversion step.
