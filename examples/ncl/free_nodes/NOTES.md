This folder contains a Logtalk version of a free nodes example described
in the Net-Clause Language (NCL) manual, available at:

https://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/project/ai-repository/ai/lang/prolog/impl/parallel/ncl/0.html

The Logtalk version uses parametric objects to represent the concept of
"net-variables" described in the paper as "global logical variables".
