% start by loading the example:

| ?- logtalk_load(self_messages(loader)).
...


% the predicate get_local/1 calls the local/1 predicate in "self",
% i.e. in the object that receives the get_local/1 message:

| ?- parent::get_local(Local).

Local = parent
yes

| ?- prototype::get_local(Local).

Local = prototype
yes


% the get_default/1 predicate also calls the default/1 predicate in
% "self" but predicate is only defined in the "parent" object; its
% definition is therefore inherited by the "prototype" object:

| ?- parent::get_default(Default).

Default = parent
yes

| ?- prototype::get_default(Local).

Default = parent
yes


% the get_undefined/1 predicate also calls the undefined/1 predicate in
% "self" but the predicate is only declared and not defined in either
% object making the messages fail as per closed world assumption:

| ?- parent::get_undefined(_).

no

| ?- prototype::get_undefined(_).

no
