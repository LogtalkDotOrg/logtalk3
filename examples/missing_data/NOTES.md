To load this example and for sample queries, please see the `SCRIPT.txt`
file.

This example illustrates how to use the expected terms library to decouple
data acquisition, which must be able to succeed when unexpected events
happen, from data processing, which decides how to handle those events.

For more details about this example, please see the comments in the 
`expecteds.lgt` source file.

See also the `cascade` and `optionals` examples.
