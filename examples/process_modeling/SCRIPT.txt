% load the example:

| ?- logtalk_load(process_modeling(loader)).
...


% compute the number of times that process "b" can be executed
% and its dependencies:

| ?- process_model::solve([b(B)], Dependencies).

B = 2, Dependencies = [a(2),b(2)] ? ;
B = 3, Dependencies = [a(2),b(3)] ? ;
B = 3, Dependencies = [a(3),b(3)]
yes


% compute the number of times that process "c" can be executed
% and its dependencies:

yes
