% start by compiling and loading the Prolog module files as objects:

| ?- logtalk_load(modules(loader)).
...


% call one of the module exported predicates using message sending:

| ?- test::names.

paulo
carlos
helena
yes


% same goal as above but the call is made using a meta-predicate
% imported from other module:

| ?- test::test.

paulo
carlos
helena
yes


% test the compilation of the module export/1 directive; module 
% exported predicates become public predicates:

| ?- exports::current_predicate(Pred).

Pred = p/1
yes

| ?- exports::predicate_property(p(_), Prop).

Prop = public ;
Prop = static ;
Prop = declared_in(exports) ;
Prop = defined_in(exports)
yes


% call the module exported/public predicate using message sending:

| ?- exports::p(N).

N = 1 ;
N = 2 ;
N = 3
yes


% test the compilation and use of meta-predicates:

| ?- test::names(Names).

Names == [paulo, carlos, helena]
yes

| ?- test::test(Names).

Names == [paulo, carlos, helena]
yes
