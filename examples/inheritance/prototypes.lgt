/*
This source file defines the following prototype-based hierarchy:

	parent
		prototype1
			descendant1
		prototype2
			descendant2
		prototype3
			descendant3

The root object imports the category "predicates", which defines one
public predicate, public/0, one protected predicate, protected/0, and
one private predicate, private/0.

All objects import the category "interface", which defines a predicate,
interface/0, for listing the object interface.
