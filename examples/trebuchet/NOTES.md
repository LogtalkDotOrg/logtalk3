This folder contains a Logtalk solution for the Advent of Code 2023 Day 1
problem:

https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/1

Copy of the problem description:

> You try to ask why they can't just use a weather machine ("not powerful
> enough") and where they're even sending you ("the sky") and why your map
> looks mostly blank ("you sure ask a lot of questions") and hang on did
> you just say the sky ("of course, where do you think snow comes from")
> when you realize that the Elves are already loading you into a trebuchet
> ("please hold still, we need to strap you in").
> 
> As they're making the final adjustments, they discover that their
> calibration document (your puzzle input) has been amended by a very
> young Elf who was apparently just excited to show off her art skills.
> Consequently, the Elves are having trouble reading the values on the
> document.
> 
> The newly-improved calibration document consists of lines of text; each
> line originally contained a specific calibration value that the Elves
> now need to recover. On each line, the calibration value can be found
> by combining the first digit and the last digit (in that order) to form
> a single two-digit number.
> 
> For example:
> 
> 1abc2
> pqr3stu8vwx
> a1b2c3d4e5f
> treb7uchet
> 
> In this example, the calibration values of these four lines are
> 12, 38, 15, and 77. Adding these together produces 142.
> 
> Consider your entire calibration document. What is the sum of all
> of the calibration values?
