To load this example and for sample queries, please see the `SCRIPT.txt`
file.

This folder contains some examples of parametric objects and categories.
Object and category parameters are logical variables that are shared with
all the entity predicates. This example illustrates accessing parameters
using the `parameter/1` and `this/1` built-in methods. Parameters can also
be accessed using _parameter variables_ as illustrated by the `parvars`
example.
