/*
	This example illustrates how to associate a set of predicates with a
	compound term. Parameters can be accessed from within an object by
	using either (1) execution-context built-in methods parameter/2 and
	this/1 or (2) using parameter variables. The first alternative is
	illustrated below.
*/



/*	The first parametric object defines some useful predicates for working
	with lists.
*/


% dealing with non-empty lists is easy;
% note that the lists are compound terms

	:- mode(last(?term), zero_or_one).

	nextto(X, Y, [_| Tail]) :-
		nextto(X, Y, Tail).

% dealing with empty lists must also be done but it's a bit tricky:

% the empty list is usually an atom, not a compound term,
% so the "extends" relation would be always wrong
