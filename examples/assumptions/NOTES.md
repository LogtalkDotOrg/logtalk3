# assumptions

This example provides a simple, limited, implementation of ground linear
and intuitionistic assumptions as discussed in the following paper:

```text

	author    = {Paul Tarau and Ver{\'o}nica Dahl and Andrew Fall},
	title     = {Backtrackable State with Linear Assumptions, Continuations and Hidden Accumulator Grammars},
	booktitle = {ILPS},
	year      = {1995},
	pages     = {642},
	crossref  = {DBLP:conf/slp/1995},
	bibsource = {DBLP, http://dblp.uni-trier.de}
}

@proceedings{DBLP:conf/slp/1995,
	editor    = {John W. Lloyd},
	title     = {Logic Programming, Proceedings of the 1995 International Symposium, Portland, Oregon, USA, December 4-7, 1995},
	booktitle = {ILPS},
	publisher = {MIT Press},
	year      = {1995},

Print Logtalk, Prolog backend, and kernel versions (if running as a notebook):

```logtalk
%versions
```

Start by loading the example:

```logtalk
logtalk_load(assumptions(loader)).
```

Paths example:

```logtalk
%%table
paths::init, paths::path(1, 5, Path).
```

<!--
Path = [1, 2, 4, 5] ;
Path = [1, 3, 5] ;
false.
-->

Switch example

```logtalk
switch::test(2).
```

<!--
two
true.
-->

```logtalk
switch::test(1).
```

<!--
one
true.
-->

```logtalk
switch::test(4).
```

<!--
unexpected(4)
true.
-->

Grades example:

```logtalk
grades::(assumel(take(hans, german)), grade(hans)).
```

<!--
true.
-->

```logtalk
grades::(assumel(take(hans, italian)), grade(hans)).
```

<!--
false.
-->
