% start by loading the design pattern sample implementations:

| ?- logtalk_load(design_patterns('behavioral/visitor/loader')).
...


% print all car components by calling the visitor/1 meta-predicate
% with a closure (use a lambda expression so that we can print a
% new-line after each component):

| ?- sedan::visitor([Component]>>(write(Component),nl)).

engine(diesel)
wheel(front_left)
wheel(front_right)
wheel(rear_right)
wheel(rear_left)
wheel(left_door)
wheel(right_door)
body(station_wagon)
yes


% use the visitor meta-predicate that is added using hot-patching:

| ?- sedan::alt_visitor([Component]>>(write(Component),nl)).

engine(diesel)
wheel(front_left)
wheel(front_right)
wheel(rear_right)
wheel(rear_left)
wheel(left_door)
wheel(right_door)
body(station_wagon)
yes


% use the standard setof/3 meta-predicate to construct a list of
% all component types:

| ?- setof(
		Type,
		Component^Arity^(sedan::component(Component), functor(Component,Type,Arity)),
		Types
     ).

Types = [body, engine, wheel]
yes
