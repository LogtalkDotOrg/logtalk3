Design pattern:
	State

Description:
	"Allow an object to alter its behavior when its internal state
	changes. The object will appear to change its class."

This pattern can be used with both classes and prototypes.

We use prototypes in this sample implementation. The context object
uses a dynamic predicate to hold the current concrete state object
identifier with a public predicate to set it. The concrete state
objects perform the context switching after handling a forwarded
client request.
