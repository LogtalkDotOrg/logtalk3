% start by loading the design pattern sample implementations:

| ?- logtalk_load(design_patterns('behavioral/memento/loader')).
...


% sample sequence of operations from "user", which plays
% the role of the caretaker in this design pattern:

| ?- originator::(
		set(s1),
		set(s2),
		save_to_memento(Momento1),
		set(s3),
		save_to_memento(Momento2),
		set(s4),
		restore_from_memento(Momento1),
		set(s5),
		restore_from_memento(Momento2)
	).

Originator: Setting state to s1
Originator: Setting state to s2
Originator: Saving to Memento.
Originator: Setting state to s3
Originator: Saving to Memento.
Originator: Setting state to s4
Originator: State after restoring from Memento: s2
Originator: Setting state to s5
Originator: State after restoring from Memento: s3
Momento1 = o1,
Momento2 = o2
yes
