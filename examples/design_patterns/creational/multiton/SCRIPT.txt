% start by loading the design pattern sample implementations:

| ?- logtalk_load(design_patterns('creational/multiton/loader')).
...


% get a list of all named instances:

| ?- multiton::instances(Instances).

Instances = [i1, i2, i3]
yes


% verify that no named instance exists until is actually requested:

| ?- \+ current_object(i1), \+ current_object(i2), \+ current_object(i3).

yes


% request to the multiton class one of its named instances:

| ?- multiton::instance(i2).

yes

| ?- current_object(i2).

yes


% try to request an instance that is not a member of the named instances:

| ?- multiton::instance(foobar).

no

| ?- current_object(foobar).

no
