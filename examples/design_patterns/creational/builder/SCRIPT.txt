% start by loading the design pattern sample implementations:

| ?- logtalk_load(design_patterns('creational/builder/loader')).
...


% parametric object version:

| ?- builder(_)::(set_wheels(3), set_seats(2), set_color(red), get_result(Car)).

Car = car(3, 2, red)
yes

| ?- car(3, 2, red)::seats(Seats).

Seats = 2
yes


% objects with dynamic state version:

| ?- builder::new(Builder).

Builder = o2
yes

| ?- o2::(set_wheels(3), set_seats(2), set_color(red), get_result(Car)).

Car = o1
yes

| ?- o1::seats(Seats).

Seats = 2
