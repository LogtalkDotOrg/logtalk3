% start by loading the design pattern sample implementations:

| ?- logtalk_load(design_patterns('structural/twin/loader')).
...


% each object can answer its messages and the messages for its
% twin object, thanks to message forwarding:

| ?- a_date::year(Year).

Year = 2018
yes

| ?- a_date::hour(Hour).

Hour = 11
yes

| ?- a_time::minutes(Minutes).

Minutes = 27
yes

| ?- a_time::day(Day).

Day = 13
yes


% we can also create twins dynamically:

| ?- time::new(twin_time, twin_date, [hour(12),minutes(37),seconds(17)]).

yes

| ?- date::new(twin_date, twin_time, [year(2003),month(9),day(23)]).

yes

| ?- twin_time::year(Year).

Year = 2003
yes

| ?- twin_date::seconds(Seconds).

Seconds = 17
yes
