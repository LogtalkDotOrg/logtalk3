% start by loading the design pattern sample implementations:

| ?- logtalk_load(design_patterns('structural/proxy/loader')).
...


% first, lets create a old enough driver, no other than
% Mr. Magoo itself (pedestrians be aware!):

| ?- driver::new(magoo, 'Mr. Magoo', 87).

yes


% in some of the cartoons, Mr. Magoo appears to be driving
% a 1929 Packard Model 645 touring car; we can define the
% car as a static object in the source file or create it
% dynamically:

| ?- create_object(packard_645, [extends(car)], [], []).

yes


% then we check, using the proxy object, that the driver
% can actually drive the car:

| ?- car_proxy(packard_645, magoo)::drive.

Car has been driven!
yes


% now, lets create a driver that is just too young, one of
% the children that Mr. Magoo sometimes babysits:

| ?- driver::new(wheeler, 'Wheeler', 7).

yes


% then we check, using the proxy object, that the child
% is effectively not allowed to drive the car:

| ?- car_proxy(packard_645, wheeler)::drive.

Sorry, Wheeler is too young to drive!
yes
