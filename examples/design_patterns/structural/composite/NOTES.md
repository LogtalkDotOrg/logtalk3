Design pattern:
	Composite

Description:
	"Compose objects into tree structures to represent part-whole
	hierarchies. Composite lets clients treat individual objects
	and compositions of objects uniformly."

This pattern can be used with both classes and prototypes.

In this sample implementation of the pattern, we choose to use classes
and object composition (i.e., composite objects will store the identifiers
of the objects that are part of the composite). In the sample queries,
we create the instances dynamically at runtime but we could also have
defined (some or all) of the instances statically in the source file.
