% start by loading the design pattern sample implementations:

| ?- logtalk_load(design_patterns('structural/decorator/loader')).
...


% send the string/0 message to the decorator object:

| ?- colored_shape(circle, red)::string.

A circle of radius 10.0
which is colored red
yes

% the diameter/1 predicate in not defined for shape or for
% colored_shape; thus our decorator forwards the message
% to the decorated circle:

| ?- colored_shape(circle, red)::diameter(Diameter).

Diameter = 20.0.
yes


% same queries but with a dynamically created object:

| ?- create_object(Circle, [extends(circle)], [], [radius(7.0)]).

Circle = o1
yes

| ?- colored_shape(o1, blue)::string.

A circle of radius 7.0
which is colored blue
yes

| ?- colored_shape(o1, blue)::diameter(Diameter).

Diameter = 14.0.
yes


% we can define a pipeline of decorators; e.g. a colored, named
% shape:

| ?- create_object(NamedShape, [extends(named_shape)], [], [shape(colored_shape(o1,blue)), name(thingy)]).

NamedShape = o2
yes

| ?- o2::string.

A circle of radius 7.0
which is colored blue
which is named thingy
yes

| ?- o2::diameter(Diameter).

Diameter = 14.0.
yes


% same queries using the decorator defined in the source file:

| ?- my_named_shape::string.

A circle of radius 10.0
which is colored green
which is named Mr. Round
yes

| ?- my_named_shape::diameter(Diameter).

Diameter = 20.0.
yes
