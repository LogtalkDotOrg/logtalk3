% start by loading the design pattern sample implementations:

| ?- logtalk_load(design_patterns('structural/bridge/loader')).
...


% draw the static instance of circle:

| ?- a_circle::draw.

API2: circle at 1.7:11.3 with radius 2.1
yes


% create a couple of dynamic circles, resize them by 25%, and draw them:

| ?- circle::new(Circle1, [drawing_api(drawing_api_1), x(1.0), y(2.0), radius(3.0)]),
     Circle1::(resize(25), draw).

API1: circle at 1.0:2.0 with radius 3.75
Circle1 = o1
yes

| ?- circle::new(Circle2, [drawing_api(drawing_api_2), x(5.0), y(7.0), radius(11.0)]),
     Circle2::(resize(25), draw).

API2: circle at 5.0:7.0 with radius 13.75
Circle2 = o2
yes
