% start by loading the design pattern sample implementations:

| ?- logtalk_load(design_patterns('structural/flyweight/loader')).
...


% add cheese brands and respective cost to the flyweight object
% using any of the shops:

| ?- shop1::(stock_cheese(white, 1.25), stock_cheese(blue, 3.75)).

yes


% all shops now have white and blue cheese at the same cost:

| ?- shop2::cheese(Brand, Cost).

Brand = white,
Cost = 1.25 ;
Brand = blue,
Cost = 3.75
yes


% both shops can sell cheese but the units sold are stored per-shop:

| ?- shop1::sell_cheese(blue, 3), shop2::sell_cheese(blue, 8).

yes


% check cheese units sold and income for each shop:

| ?- shop1::(total_units_sold(Units), total_income(Income)).

Total = 3
Income = 11.25
yes

| ?- shop2::(total_units_sold(Units), total_income(Income)).
