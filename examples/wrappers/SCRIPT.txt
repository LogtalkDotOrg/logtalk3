% start by loading the hook object:

| ?- logtalk_load(wrappers(wrapper)).
...


% compile the "zipper.pl" plain Prolog source file using the hook object:

| ?- logtalk_load('zipper.pl', [hook(wrapper)]).
...


% try one of the generated "zipper" object predicates:

| ?- zipper<<(zipper(3, [1,2,3,4,5], Zip, X), next(Zip, Next)).
Zip = zip([2, 1], 3, [4, 5]), X = 3, Next = zip([3, 2, 1], 4, [5])
