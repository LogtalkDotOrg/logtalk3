/* 
   Find the largest clique in a graph. A clique is a sub-graph that is 
   complete, i.e., any two vertices are connected.
   Problem Source: http://www.cs.sunysb.edu/~algorith/
   Algorithm: native generate-test algorithm. The fast one is in clique_fast.pl
   Program written by Neng-Fa Zhou, 3. 2002
