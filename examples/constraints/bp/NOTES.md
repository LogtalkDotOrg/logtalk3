To load this example and for sample queries, please see the `SCRIPT.txt` file.

This folder contains a set of simple examples illustrating how to use B-Prolog
constraint support with Logtalk. These examples are adapted with permission 
from the original author, Neng-Fa Zhou.

The B-Prolog `::/2` finite-domain built-in predicate clashes with the Logtalk 
`::/2` message sending operator. The solution is to use instead the alternative
B-Prolog `in/2` built-in predicate.

The built-in `predicate_property/2` predicate fails to report some of the 
constraint predicates as built-in predicates. One workaround is to encapsulate
calls to these predicates using the `{}/1` Logtalk control construct.
