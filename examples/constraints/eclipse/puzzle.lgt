% code adapted to Logtalk by Paulo Moura from one of the examples
% found on the ECLiPSe 5.10#141 documentation (August 2008)


% the constraint solver libraries must always be loaded prior to compilation of 
% the individual example files:
:- lib(ic).


:- object(puzzle).

	:- public([sendmore1/1, sendmore2/1]).

	% we must define an alias (ins/2) for the ECLiPSe "ic" library operator ::/2
	% in order to avoid conflicts with the ::/2 Logtalk message sending operator
	% ECLiPSE 6.0#78 adds an alias in_set_range/2 for ::/2 that could also be used
	:- use_module(ic, [alldifferent/1, (::)/2:ins/2, labeling/1, (#=)/2, (#\=)/2]).
	:- op(700, xfx, ins).

	sendmore1(Digits) :-
		Digits = [S,E,N,D,M,O,R,Y],
		Digits ins [0..9],
		alldifferent(Digits),
		S #\= 0,
		M #\= 0,
		             1000*S + 100*E + 10*N + D
		           + 1000*M + 100*O + 10*R + E
		#= 10000*M + 1000*O + 100*N + 10*E + Y,
		labeling(Digits).

	% different model, with carries
