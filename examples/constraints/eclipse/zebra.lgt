% Lewis Carrol's classical puzzle with five houses and a zebra:
% 
% Five men with different nationalities live in the first five houses
% of a street.  They practise five distinct professions, and each of
% them has a favourite animal and a favourite drink, all of them
% different.  The five houses are painted in different colours.
% 
% The Englishman lives in a red house.
% The Spaniard owns a dog.
% The Japanese is a painter.
% The Italian drinks tea.
% The Norwegian lives in the first house on the left.
% The owner of the green house drinks coffee.
% The green house is on the right of the white one.
% The sculptor breeds snails.
% The diplomat lives in the yellow house.
% Milk is drunk in the middle house.
% The Norwegian's house is next to the blue one.
% The violinist drinks fruit juice.
% The fox is in a house next to that of the doctor.
% The horse is in a house next to that of the diplomat.
% 
% Who owns a Zebra, and who drinks water?
% 


% the constraint solver libraries must always be loaded prior to compilation of 
% the individual example files:
:- lib(ic).


:- object(zebra).

	:- public(zebra/0).

	% we must define an alias (ins/2) for the ECLiPSe "ic" library operator ::/2
	% in order to avoid conflicts with the ::/2 Logtalk message sending operator
	% ECLiPSE 6.0#78 adds an alias in_set_range/2 for ::/2 that could also be used
	:- use_module(ic, [alldifferent/1, (::)/2:ins/2, labeling/1, (#=)/2]).
	:- op(700, xfx, ins).

	:- use_module(lists, [flatten/2, memberchk/2]).
