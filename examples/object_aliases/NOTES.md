file.

This is a minimal example illustrating the use of the `uses/1` directive
to experiment with different object implementations of the same protocol
when using explicit message sending. The main idea is to have a single
source line that can be edited to switch between different implementations
as all message sending calls would be written using the object alias.
This is an alternative to accomplish the same goal by using a `uses/2`
directive and implicit message sending. Note that both alternatives allow
compiling the code in optimized mode to take advantage of static binding
for the message sending calls.

This example also illustrates defining an alias for an object defined at
runtime using a _parameter variable_.
