This folder contains an example of defining and running unit tests using
the test dialects supported by default by the Logtalk `lgtunit` tool. See
also the `quick_check` and `tests_dsl` examples.

To define tests for your own project, see the `lgtunit` tool documentation
and the `tests-sample.lgt` and `tester-sample.lgt` sample files in the root
of the distribution.
