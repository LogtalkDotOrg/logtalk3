To load this example and for sample queries, please see the `SCRIPT.txt`
file.

This example illustrates how to define "class methods" as found on class-
based object-oriented programming languages such as Java or Objective-C.
Logtalk classes are objects. Therefore, class methods are simply instance
methods defined in the class of the class, i.e. in its meta-class.

This example defines the following objects:

- `circle`  
	class representing common features of geometric circles
	such as radius and position

- `metacircle`  
	meta-class of class circle defining "class methods" for
	creating instances and calculating areas

- `c42`  
	static instance of class `circle`
