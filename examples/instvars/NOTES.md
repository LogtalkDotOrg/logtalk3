file.

This folder contains an example that shows how to implement instance
variables as defined in class-based object-oriented programming languages.

This example defines a root class, `root`, and three instances, `instance1`, 
`instance2`, and `instance3`. The root class defines an instance variable 
(using a dynamic predicate) and the corresponding setter and getter methods.
The root class is used to store a default value for the instance variable.
