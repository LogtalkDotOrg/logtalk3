# patches

This folder contains an example that shows how to use a complementing
category to replace a broken predicate definition and to add a new imported
category to an existing object (without modifying its source code), thus
providing hot patching functionality similar to Objective-C categories.

The complemented objects must be compiled with the flag `complements` set
to `allow` (its default value is usually `deny`). This solution was adapted
to improve performance of applications that don't make use complementing
categories and to provide a solution for preventing the use of categories
to break object encapsulation. Note that the `complements` flag can be set
on a per-object basis by using the `set_logtalk_flag/2` directive.

Start by loading the example:

```logtalk
logtalk_load(patches(loader)).
```

Find categories that complement objects:

```logtalk
%%table
complements_object(Category, Object).
```

<!--
Category = patch, Object = proto.
-->

Verify the patch in the `patch` category for the predicate `init/0`
defined in the object `proto`:

```logtalk
proto::init.
```

<!--
parent init
proto init

true.
-->

Verify the imported category added to the `proto` object by the
`patch` category:

```logtalk
proto::pet(Pet).
```

<!--
Pet = cat.
-->
