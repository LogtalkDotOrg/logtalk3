This example illustrates a simple solution for serializing dynamic objects
that conform to a given protocol. The serialization data is saved to a file.
Restoring this file recreates the serialized objects. Object identities are
not perserved however. This example assumes that the dynamic objects contain
only facts. See also the `persistency` example.
