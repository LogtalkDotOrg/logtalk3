To load this example and for sample queries, please see the `SCRIPT.txt` file.

This folder contains an example that shows how to implement class variables
as defined in Smalltalk. The name shared instance variables is however much
more accurate. In systems like Logtalk, which enables the use of explicit
metaclasses, true class variables are just the class (as an object) own
instance variables!

This example defines a root class, `root` and three instances, `instance1`,
`instance2`, and `instance3`. The root class defines a shared instance variable
(using a dynamic predicate) and the setter and getter methods which implement
the variable sharing behavior.
