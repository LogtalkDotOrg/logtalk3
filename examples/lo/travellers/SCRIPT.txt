% start by loading the example:

| ?- logtalk_load(lo_travellers(loader)).
...


% build a route by adding one town at a time:

| ?- incremental::route([london, brighton, portsmouth, exeter, oxford, aberystwyth], Route).

Route = oxford-london-portsmouth-brighton-exeter-aberystwyth ;
...


% presort towns by geographical distance before using the incremental algorithm:

| ?- presort::route([london, brighton, portsmouth, exeter, oxford, aberystwyth], Route).

Route = brighton-london-oxford-portsmouth-exeter-aberystwyth ;
...


% come home after the journey:

| ?- circular::route([london, brighton, portsmouth, exeter, oxford, aberystwyth], Route).

Route = london-brighton-portsmouth-exeter-aberystwyth-oxford-london ;
...


% blind search by generating permutations of the list of towns:

| ?- permute::route([london, brighton, portsmouth, exeter, oxford, aberystwyth], Route).

Route = (aberystwyth-exeter-portsmouth-brighton-london-oxford,273.6237583942784)
