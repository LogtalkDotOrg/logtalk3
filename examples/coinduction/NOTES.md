To load this example and for sample queries, please see the `SCRIPT.txt` file.
This example requires a recent version of CxProlog, ECLiPSE, SICStus Prolog,
SWI-Prolog, or YAP as the backend Prolog compiler.

Note that Logtalk support for coinduction is still experimental. The two major
issues are lack of robust Prolog support for cyclic terms and lack of support
for tabling of cyclic terms. The first issue prevents using of some backend
Prolog compilers. The second issue may prevent some coinductive predicates to
behave as (theoretically) expected.

This folder contains several examples of coinductive predicates, adapted from
the coinduction papers and from the Feliks Kluzniak's DRA meta-interpreter.

The unit tests are currently disabled when using CxProlog or ECLiPSE as the
backend compiler. Although some tests pass, all tests calling `bagof/3` don't
terminate until all available memory is exhausted due to the fragile support
for rational terms in these two Prolog compilers.
