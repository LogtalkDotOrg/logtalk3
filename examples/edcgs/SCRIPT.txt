% start by loading the example:

| ?- logtalk_load(edcgs(loader)).
...


% construct a [1,2,...,N] list:

| ?- list_constructors::flist(7, [], L).
L = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
yes

% construct a [N,...,2,1] list:

| ?- list_constructors::rlist(7, L, []).
L = [7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
yes


% sum the natural numbers 1..4:

| ?- list_sums::sum_first_n(4, 0, Sum),
Sum = 10
yes

% sum the elements of a list:

| ?- list_sums::sum([2,2,3], Sum).
Sum = 7
yes


% return the set of elements present in a list:

| ?- unique::unique([a], Unique).
Unique = [a]
yes

| ?- unique::unique([a,b,a], Unique).
Unique = [a,b]
yes


% compute the length of a list:

| ?- synopsis::len([a,b,a], Len).
Len = 3
yes
