# edcgs

For a description of this example, please see the comments in the example
source files and the original individual examples by Peter Van Roy at:

https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Pubs/TechRpts/1990/CSD-90-583.pdf

Some examples and tests written by Michael Hendricks for his `edcg`
SWI-Prolog pack repo at:

https://github.com/mndrix/edcg

Print Logtalk, Prolog backend, and kernel versions (if running as a notebook):

```logtalk
%versions
```

Start by loading the example:

```logtalk
logtalk_load(edcgs(loader)).
```

Construct a [1,2,...,N] list:

```logtalk
list_constructors::flist(7, [], L).
```

<!--
L = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7].
-->

Construct a [N,...,2,1] list:

```logtalk
list_constructors::rlist(7, L, []).
```

<!--
L = [7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1].
-->

Sum the natural numbers 1..4:

```logtalk
list_sums::sum_first_n(4, 0, Sum).
```

<!--
Sum = 10.
-->

Sum the elements of a list:

```logtalk
list_sums::sum([2,2,3], Sum).
```

<!--
Sum = 7.
-->

Return the set of elements present in a list:

```logtalk
unique::unique([a], Unique).
```

<!--
Unique = [a].
-->

```logtalk
unique::unique([a,b,a], Unique).
```

<!--
Unique = [a,b].
-->

Compute the length of a list:

```logtalk
synopsis::len([a,b,a], Len).
```

<!--
Len = 3.
-->
