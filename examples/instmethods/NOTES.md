To load this example and for sample queries, please see the `SCRIPT.txt`
file.

This folder contains an example of instance defined methods. When using 
classes and instances, methods must be declared in a class but the method 
definitions may be stored in the instances, either overriding or specializing 
the class definitions.

This example defines the following objects:

- `root`  
	root class defining a method named `method/0`

- `instance1`  
	simple instance of root inheriting `method/0`

- `instance2`  
	instance of root overriding the inherited method `method/0`

- `instance3`  
	instance of root specializing the inherited method `method/0`
