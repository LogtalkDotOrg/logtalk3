# viewpoints

Example adapted from the chapter "Classifying Prototype-Based Programming
Languages" by Christophe Dony, Jacques Malenfant, and Daniel Bardou, found 
on the book "Prototype-Based Programming - Concepts, Languages, and 
Applications" published by Springer.

This prototype programming example illustrates how we can do both property 
sharing and value sharing in Logtalk by calling the built-in predicate 
modification methods `asserta/1`, `assertz/1`, and `retract/1` either in
the context of "this" or in the context of "self".

In this example we have a prototype, `joe_person`, containing general data
on Joe such as its age, name, or address, and four descendant prototypes
or viewpoints, `joe_sportsman`, `joe_employee`, `joe_chess_player`, and
`joe_film_enthusiast`. Each descendant contains data related to a particular
viewpoint about Joe.

Start by loading the example:

```logtalk
logtalk_load(viewpoints(loader)).
```

<!--
true.
-->

We can start by asking joe its age:

```logtalk
joe_person::age(Age).
```

<!--
Age = 30.
-->

The same question could be made via any of its viewpoints:

```logtalk
joe_sportsman::age(Age).
```

<!--
Age = 30
-->

Now let's tell joe to get older:

```logtalk
joe_person::grow_older.
```

<!--
true.
-->

We can verify the effect of the above message from any of the viewpoints:

```logtalk
joe_chess_player::age(Age).
```

<!--
Age = 31
-->

Because the `growOld/0` and the `age/1` predicates are implemented using 
property sharing, we can send the `grow_older/0` message to any viewpoint:

```logtalk
joe_employee::grow_older.
```

<!--
true.
-->

We can check this by asking joe its age:

```logtalk
joe_person::age(Age).
```

<!--
Age = 32
-->

As you can see, although the modification message have been sent to a 
descendant, its the predicate `age/1` in the parent that got updated.

To illustrate value sharing we use a couple of predicates, `score/1`
and `set_score/0`, defined in `joe_person`:

```logtalk
joe_person::score(Score).
```

<!--
Score = 0.
-->

Initially, `score/1` is only defined for `joe_person`, so every descendant 
or viewpoint will share its value/definition:

```logtalk
joe_employee::score(Score).
```

<!--
Score = 0.
-->

But if we decide to increment the counter by sending the `set_score/0` message
to a descendant (don't use message broadcasting syntax in order to workaround
a XSB parser bug):

```logtalk
joe_chess_player::set_score(2200), joe_chess_player::score(Score).
```

<!--
Score = 2200.
-->

Then the descendant will now have a local definition for `counter/1`,
independent of the definition in its parent, `joe_person`:

```logtalk
joe_person::score(Score).
```

<!--
Score = 0.
-->

The other descendants/viewpoints will continue to share the definition 
in `joe_person`:

```logtalk
joe_sportsman::score(Score).
```

<!--
Score = 0.
-->
