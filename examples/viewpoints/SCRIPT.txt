% start by loading the example:

| ?- logtalk_load(viewpoints(loader)).
...


% we can start by asking joe its age:

| ?- joePerson::age(Age).

Age = 30
yes


% the same question could be made via any of its viewpoints:

| ?- joeSportsman::age(Age).

Age = 30
yes


% now let's tell joe to get older:

| ?- joePerson::getOlder.

yes


% we can verify the effect of the above message from any of the viewpoints:

| ?- joeChessPlayer::age(Age).

Age = 31
yes


% because the growOld/0 and the age/1 predicates are implemented using 
% property sharing, we can send the getOlder/0 message to any viewpoint:

| ?- joeEmployee::getOlder.

yes


% we can check this by asking joe its age:


| ?- joePerson::age(Age).

Age = 32
yes


% as you can see, although the modification message have been sent to a 
% descendant, its the predicate age/1 in the parent that got updated


% to illustrate value sharing we use a couple of predicates, score/1 and
% setScore/0, defined in joePerson:


| ?- joePerson::score(Score).

Score = 0
yes


% initially, score/1 is only defined for joePerson, so every descendant 
% or viewpoint will share its value/definition:

| ?- joeEmployee::score(Score).

Score = 0
yes


% but if we decide to increment the counter by sending the setScore/0 message to a descendant
% (don't use message broadcasting syntax in order to workaround a XSB parser bug):

| ?- joeChessPlayer::setScore(2200), joeChessPlayer::score(Score).

Score = 2200
yes


% then the descendant will now have a local definition for counter/1,
% independent of the definition in its parent, joePerson:

| ?- joePerson::score(Score).

Score = 0
yes


% the other descendants/viewpoints will continue to share the definition 
% in joePerson:

| ?- joeSportsman::score(Score).

Score = 0
yes
