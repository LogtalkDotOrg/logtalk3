# module_aliases

This is a minimal example illustrating the use of the Logtalk `use_module/1`
directive to module aliases (not to be confused by the Prolog directive with
the same name). It requires backend support for modules and the `use_module/2`
directive.

Print Logtalk, Prolog backend, and kernel versions (if running as a notebook):

```logtalk
%versions
```

Check that the Prolog backend supports modules:

```logtalk
current_logtalk_flag(modules, supported).
```

Start by loading the example:

```logtalk
logtalk_load(module_aliases(loader)).
```

Demonstration of using aliases for using or experimenting with different
modules:

```logtalk
data_source::all(Data).
```

<!--
...
Data = [1,2,3].
-->

Demonstration of using module aliases with parametric objects:

```logtalk
pardata(data1)::all(Data).
```

<!--
...
Data = [1,2,3].
-->

```logtalk
pardata(data2)::all(Data).
```

<!--
...
Data = [4,5,6]
-->
