This is a simple example of defining and using futures, a common concurrent
programming idiom. A future is used to represent a term that may not yet be
available due to a pending asynchronous computation. Futures are supported
in Logtalk using its high-level multi-threading features. This example uses
computations over lists as representative of long running operations that
would benefit from asynchronous calls.
