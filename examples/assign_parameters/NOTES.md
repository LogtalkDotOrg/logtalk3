To load this example and for sample queries, please see the `SCRIPT.txt` file.

This example illustrates the use of assignable variables and parametric 
objects as alternative implementation to dynamic object predicates for
storing (backtrackable) object state. For more information on assignable 
variables please consult the URL:

	http://www.kprolog.com/en/logical_assignment/

The objects in this example make use of the library category `assignvars`.
This category contains an adaptation of the pure logical subset implementation
of assignable variables by Nobukuni Kino, which can be found on the URL above.
