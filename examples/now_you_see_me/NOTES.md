To load this example and for sample queries, please see the `SCRIPT.txt` file.

This example illustrates that the implementation of dynamic predicates must
ensure that retracting all local clauses for an inherited dynamic predicate
restores the visibility of any inherited definition. This also have direct
consequences for the implementation and optimization of `^^/1` calls. For
more information on this example, please see the comments in the example
source files. The example is inspired by the "Now You See Me" movie, whose
main characters are four stage magicians known as the "Four Horsemen".
