To load this example and for sample queries, please see the `SCRIPT.txt` file.

This example shows the use of meta-predicates in Logtalk. Meta-predicates are 
predicates whose head includes arguments that will be called as goals in the 
body of the predicate definition.

This example defines the following objects:

- `company`  
    usage example of the `map_reduce/5` meta-predicate

- `fibonacci`  
    example of calculating Fibonacci numbers using the `fold_left/4`
    meta-predicate

- `sort(_)`  
	this is a parametric object containing a method that implements the
	quicksort sorting algorithm; the parameter is interpreted as the type
	of the elements being sorted

- `tracer`  
	this object implements a meta-predicate that is used by `sort(_)` to 
	trace the sorting algorithm steps

- `metapreds`, `descendant`, and `test`  
	objects used for illustrating the use of closures as meta-arguments

- `predicates`  
	object defining some predicates for testing meta-predicates defined 
	in the Logtalk library

- `grammar`  
	object illustrating using `phrase/2` as a meta-predicate meta-argument
