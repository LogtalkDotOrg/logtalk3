This example contains Logtalk source files that cannot be compiled but
can be interpreted as scripts and open as Jupyter notebooks using the
Jupytext package. See the files comments for formatting details. The
main advantages of writing these scripts as source files, in alternative
to write notebooks, is to benefit from common text editor features such
as syntax coloring and code completion. These scripts are also friendlier
for source code versioning compared with the default JSON representation
for notebooks.
