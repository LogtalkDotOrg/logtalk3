file.

This simple programming example illustrates that "super" calls (the (^^)/1
control construct) preserve the value of "self" when calling an inherited
definition. This allows any `::/1` goal in the called inherited definition
to work as expected in the correct context. This example also illustrates
that "super" calls require dynamic binding when the called predicate is
dynamic.
