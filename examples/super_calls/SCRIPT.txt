% start by loading the example:

| ?- logtalk_load(super_calls(loader)).
...


% the predicate get_local/1 calls the local/1 predicate in "self",
% i.e. in the object that receives the get_local/1 message:

| ?- parent::get_local(Local).

Local = parent
yes

| ?- prototype::get_local(Local).

Local = prototype
yes


% the prototype::correct/1 predicate makes a "super" call, which preserves
% "self", to the inherited get_local/1 predicate:

| ?- prototype::correct(Local).

Local = prototype
yes


% the prototype::wrong/1 predicate sends a message to the parent, which
% (necessarily) resets "self" to the message receiver:

| ?- prototype::wrong(Local).

Local = parent
yes
