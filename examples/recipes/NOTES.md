# recipes

This example is inspired by a StackOverflow question for which a sketch of a
Logtalk-based solution was provided:

	http://stackoverflow.com/questions/26119110/knowledge-representation-in-prolog-how-to-store-data

It illustrates a possible solution for representing structured data using
objects and also hot patching of running code. It also shows when a mixed
representation using both data objects and Prolog facts can be managed.

The main files defined in this example are:

- `specs.lgt`  
	defines the recipe protocol, `recipep`, declaring recipe description
	predicates and a prototype object, `proto_recipe`, defining handy
	predicates for summarizing recipe information
- `recipes.lgt`  
	defines some recipes represented as objects
- `parametric.lgt`  
	defines some recipes represented as facts for a `recipe/3` predicate
	plus a `recipe/3` parametric object and a `recipe/1` predicate for
	enumerating recipes while abstracting their representation

- `patch_1.lgt` and `patch_2.lgt`  
	categories used to illustrate hot patching of the example objects

Print Logtalk, Prolog backend, and kernel versions (if running as a notebook):

```logtalk
%versions
```

Start by loading the example:

```logtalk
logtalk_load(recipes(loader)).
```

List all the ingredients required for the green soup recipe:

```logtalk
green_soup::ingredients(Ingredients).
```

<!--
Ingredients = [peas,cream,water,oil].
-->

List all the steps required to make mashed peas:

```logtalk
mashed_peas::steps(Steps).
```

<!--
Steps = [1-'Boil the peas.',2-'Mash the peas',3-'Add salt and mix.'].
-->

Find out what dishes you can cook with green peas (we check that
we have a ground recipe to skip the generic recipe represented 
by the `recipe/3` parametric object):

```logtalk
%%table
conforms_to_protocol(Recipe, recipep), ground(Recipe), Recipe::ingredient(peas).
```

<!--
Recipe = green_soup ? ;
Recipe = mashed_peas ? ;
false.
-->

Patch the prototypical recipe to add a `level/1` descriptor to all recipes:

```logtalk
logtalk_load(recipes(patch_1)).
```

<!--
true.
-->

Recipes are now easy by default:

```logtalk
mashed_peas::level(Level).
```

<!--
Level = easy.
-->

But you always get into trouble while making green soup; add a second patch
to define the level value for this recipe to be "hard":

```logtalk
logtalk_load(recipes(patch_2)).
```

<!--
true.
-->

Confirm the patched level:

```logtalk
green_soup::level(Level).
```

<!--
Level = hard.
-->

When using a mixed representation, the `conforms_to_protocol/2` built-in
predicate is not ideal to enumerate recipes as it will also return the
parametric object used for accessing recipes represented as Prolog facts:

```logtalk
%%table
conforms_to_protocol(Recipe, recipep).
```

<!--
Recipe = green_soup ;
Recipe = mashed_peas ;
Recipe = recipe(_, _, _) ;
false.
-->

Thus, to enumerate recipes, is best to use the `recipe/1` predicate, which
ensures that we always get a proper recipe:

```logtalk
%%table
recipe(Recipe).
```

<!--
Recipe = green_soup ;
Recipe = mashed_peas ;
Recipe = recipe('Chocolate Chip Cookies', [flour-500-gr, butter-20-gr, chocolate-200-gr, sugar-65-gr, eggs-2-units], ['mix flour, butter and sugar'-10-min, 'add eggs and mix'-10-min, 'make chocolate chips'-5-min, 'split in small portions'-5-min, 'cook in the oven'-25-min]) ;
Recipe = recipe('Berries and cream', [cream-500-ml, sugar-50-gr, strawberries-300-gr, chocolate-100-gr], ['mix whipping cream add sugar'-5-min, 'slice strawberries'-5-min, 'place alternate layers of cream and strawberries in dessert dishes'-10-min, 'make chocolate chips'-5-min, 'top dishes with chocolate chips'-5-min]) ;
false.
-->

An usage example of the `recipe/1` predicate would be:

```logtalk
%%table
recipe(Recipe), Recipe::cooking_time(CookingTime).
```

<!--
Recipe = green_soup, CookingTime = 36 ;
Recipe = mashed_peas, CookingTime = 16 ;
Recipe = recipe('Chocolate Chip Cookies', [flour-500-gr, butter-20-gr, chocolate-200-gr, sugar-65-gr, eggs-2-units], ['mix flour, butter and sugar'-10-min, 'add eggs and mix'-10-min, 'make chocolate chips'-5-min, 'split in small portions'-5-min, 'cook in the oven'-25-min]), CookingTime = 55 ;
Recipe = recipe('Berries and cream', [cream-500-ml, sugar-50-gr, strawberries-300-gr, chocolate-100-gr], ['mix whipping cream add sugar'-5-min, 'slice strawberries'-5-min, 'place alternate layers of cream and strawberries in dessert dishes'-10-min, 'make chocolate chips'-5-min, 'top dishes with chocolate chips'-5-min]), CookingTime = 30 ;
false.
