% the recipe descriptors are specified in the following protocol

:- protocol(recipep).

	:- public([
		name/1, ingredient/3, step/3
	]).

:- end_protocol.


% next, we define a prototypical recipe object, which implements the recipe
% protocol and adds some convenient predicates

:- object(proto_recipe).

	% allow this object to be (hot) patched
	:- set_logtalk_flag(complements, allow).

	:- public([
		ingredient/1, ingredients/1, steps/1,
		cooking_time/1
	]).

	ingredient(Ingredient) :-
		::ingredient(Ingredient,_,_).

	ingredients(Ingredients) :-
		findall(Ingredient, ::ingredient(Ingredient,_,_), Ingredients).

	steps(Steps) :-
		findall(Order-Step, ::step(Order,Step,_), Steps).

	cooking_time(CookingTime) :-
		findall(StepTime, ::step(_,_,StepTime), StepTimes),
		sum(StepTimes, CookingTime).

	% auxiliary predicates

	sum(Numbers, Total) :-
		sum(Numbers, 0, Total).

	sum([], Total, Total).
	sum([Number| Numbers], Total0, Total) :-
		Total1 is Total0 + Number,
		sum(Numbers, Total1, Total).

:- end_object.
