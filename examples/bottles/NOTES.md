# bottles

This folder contains a Logtalk version of the programming problem
"99 bottles of beer on the wall", contributed to the web site:

http://99-bottles-of-beer.net/

Print Logtalk, Prolog backend, and kernel versions (if running as a notebook):

```logtalk
%versions
```

Simply load the example, which contains an `initialization/1` directive 
that runs it:

```logtalk
logtalk_load(bottles(loader)).
```
