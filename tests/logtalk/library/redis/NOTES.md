This directory contains unit tests for the Redis client library but
these tests also serve as examples of using this library. The tests
assume a local Redis server running on the default port. If the server
is not detected, the tests are skipped.

The unit tests were originally written by Sean Charles for his GNU Prolog
Redis client library:

	https://github.com/emacstheviking/gnuprolog-redisclient

The Logtalk version is a straight-forward port of the original tests using
the `test/1` dialect of `lgtunit`.
