This folder contains minimal support for using Exuberant Ctags  with Logtalk:

	http://ctags.sourceforge.net/

To install, copy the `ctags` file to `$HOME/.ctags` or append its contents to
the `$HOME/.ctags` file if it already exists.

Several text editors (e.g. Atom, Sublime Text, TextMate, and Vim) support code
navigation using ctags. Check the text editor documentation and the Logtalk
support provided by this distribution for details.
