This directory contains a file that provides basic syntax highlighting 
for editing Logtalk source files with the text editor TextPad 4.5 and 
later versions. TextPad is available from:

	http://www.textpad.com

To install, first, copy the file `logtalk.syn` to the TextPad syntax folder
and the file `Logtalk.tcl` to the `clip` library folder (see the preferences
pane from within the TextPad application for the folders location). Second,
define a new document class for Logtalk source files (whose extensions are
`.lgt` and `.logtalk`) and for Prolog adapter files (whose extension is
usually `.pl`).

THE SYNTAX FILE AND THE CLIP LIBRARY ARE UNDER DEVELOPMENT.
