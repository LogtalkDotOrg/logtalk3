This document describes how to configure, run and deploy the Logtalk Plugin for IntelliJ.

## Preliminary steps

- Accomplish the preliminary steps for plugin development as recommended at the [IntelliJ Platform SDK DevGuide](http://www.jetbrains.org/intellij/sdk/docs/basics/getting_started/setting_up_environment.html).
Particularly, verify that the _IntelliJ Platform SDK_ is properly configured.

## Configuring the project

- From the IntelliJ `File` menu, select `New -> Project...`.

- In the panel of the left, select: `IntelliJ Platform Plugin`. 
In the panel of the right verify that the Project SDK corresponds to the IntelliJ SDK. Click `Next`.

- In the `Project name` text field write: `logtalk-idea`. 
In the `Project location` text field write: `<LOGTALK_DIR>/coding/idea`.
Click `Finish`.

- In the `Project` view, right click on the `gen` folder and select: `Mark Directory as` -> `Generated Sources Root`.


## Running the plugin

The first time you run the plugin you may need to create a `Run Configuration`. Follow these steps:

- Select the `logtalk-idea` module in the `Project` view.

- From the `Run` menu choose `Run Plugin`.


## Preparing the plugin for deployment.

- Once the new version is looking good, update the version number and change notes at the `plugin.xml` deployment descriptor.
It is located in the `resources/META-INF` directory.

- From the `Build` menu, select `Prepare Plugin Module <plugin name> for deployment`. 
A deployable plugin jar file will be generated in the plugin directory.


## Deploying the plugin.

### Deployment to the IntelliJ Plugin Repository

- Update the plugin JAR at the [IntelliJ plugin site](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/9425-logtalk).
You will need to login first.


### Local Deployment

Take the jar file and copy it to your local IntelliJ plugin repository (typically at `~/.IntelliJIdeaXXX/config/plugins`).
 You may need to restart IntelliJ to see the changes applied.
 Do not forget to verify in the `Settings` dialog that the plugin is enabled.
