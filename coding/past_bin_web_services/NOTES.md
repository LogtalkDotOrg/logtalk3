Some paste bin web services support Logtalk/Prolog syntax highlighting.
These include:

http://dumpz.org/ 
http://pzt.me/ 
http://plakkert.nl/ 
http://pastebin.com/ 
http://love.paste.to/

There are likely a few others (most paste web services seem to use the
GeSHi syntax highlighter, which includes support for Logtalk/Prolog in
its latest releases).
