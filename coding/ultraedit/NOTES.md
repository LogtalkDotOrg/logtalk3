This directory contains files that provides basic syntax coloring,
code folding, and entity list for editing Logtalk source files with
the UltraEdit text editor:

	http://www.ultraedit.com/

To install copy the file `logtalk.uew` to the user `wordfiles` folder.
The default location of this folder depends on the operating-system:

	macOS:    ~/Library/Application Support/UltraEdit
	Windows:  %appdata%\IDMComp\UltraEdit\wordfiles
	Linux:    ~/.idm/uex

Make sure the `logtalk.uew` file uses DOS line terminators (CR/LF). You
can use UltraEdit itself to convert the file to DOS line terminators if
necessary.
