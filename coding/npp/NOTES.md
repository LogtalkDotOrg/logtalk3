This directory contains files that provides basic syntax coloring and 
code completion for editing Logtalk source files with the text editor 
Notepad++ 3.9 or later version:

	http://notepad-plus.sourceforge.net/

These support files are dual-licensed under the Apache License 2.0 and
the Notepad++ license.

Install the supporting files by performing the following steps:

1.	Copy the file "userDefineLang.xml" to the folder "%APPDATA%\Notepad++".
	If the file already exists, merge the contents of the two files.

2.	In order to use auto-completion, copy the file "logtalk.api" to the 
	directory YOUR_NPP_INSTALL_DIR\plugins\APIs.


THESE SYNTAX COLORING SUPPORT FILES ARE UNDER DEVELOPMENT.
