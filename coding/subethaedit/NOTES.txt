This directory contains files that provide syntax highlighting 
for editing Logtalk source files with the SubEthaEdit 1.x text 
editor (http://www.codingmonkeys.de/subethaedit/).


To install copy the file "logtalk.plist" either to the folder:

	~/Library/Application Support/SubEthaEdit/Syntax Definitions/

or to the folder:

	/Library/Application Support/SubEthaEdit/Syntax Definitions/

(create the folder if it does not exist).

Logtalk source files (including the library entities and the programming
examples) are formatted using tabs (the recommended setting is a tab width
equivalent to 4 spaces); you may set the tab width on the editor preference
panel.
