This directory contains files that provide syntax highlighting 
for editing Logtalk source files with the SubEthaEdit 1.x text 
editor (http://www.codingmonkeys.de/subethaedit/).


To install copy the file "logtalk.plist" either to the folder:

	~/Library/Application Support/SubEthaEdit/Syntax Definitions/

or to the folder:

	/Library/Application Support/SubEthaEdit/Syntax Definitions/

(create the folder if it does not exist).

Logtalk source files (including the library entities and the programming
examples) are indented using tabs and are expected to remain perfectly 
indented no matter your tab width preference (a common setting is a tab
width equivalent to 4 spaces).
