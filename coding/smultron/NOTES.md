This directory contains the Logtalk.plist file that provides basic syntax 
coloring, code completion, and entity index (using the "function" list)
for editing Logtalk source files with the Smultron 2.2 text editor:

	http://smultron.sourceforge.net/

These support files are dual-licensed under the Apache License 2.0 and the
Smultron license.

To install:

1. Copy the file "logtalk.plist" to the application bundle (ctrl-click on 
Smultron and choose Show Package Contents and then navigate to the folder
Contents/Resources/Syntax Definitions/).

2. Copy the file "SyntaxDefinitions.plist" to the folder:

	~/Library/Application Support/Smultron

If the file already exists, merge the contents of the two files.

Logtalk source files (including the library entities and the programming
examples) are indented using tabs and are expected to remain perfectly 
indented no matter your tab width preference (a common setting is a tab
width equivalent to 4 spaces).
