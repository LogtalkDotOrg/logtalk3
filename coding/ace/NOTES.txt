Ace is an embeddable code editor written in JavaScript available from:

	http://ace.c9.io/

In order to use Ace for editing Logtalk source files, copy the files
`logtalk.js` and `logtalk_highlight_rules.js` to the `lib/ace/mode`
sub-directory of your Ace installation directory.

The supporting files are work in progress and were obtained by first
automatically converting the `Logtalk.tmLanguage` TextMate file using
Ace's TMLanguage Tool and fixing some of the resulting conversion issues.

The `logtalk.js` and `logtalk_highlight_rules.js` files are licensed under
the BSD license as other Ace mode files.
