This directory contains a `logtalk.el` file that provides syntax 
highlighting for editing Logtalk source files with the Emacs text 
editor:

These support files are dual-licensed under the Apache License 2.0 and the
Emacs license.

To install follow the instructions contained in the file itself.

Emacs regular expressions don't support look-ahead assertions, which
result is syntax coloring errors in valid code such as the `0'"` term.
