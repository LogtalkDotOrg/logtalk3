This directory contains the `logtalk.rb` file that provides syntax 
coloring support for Rouge (version 1.9.1 or later):

	http://rouge.jneen.net/

These support files are dual-licensed under the Apache License 2.0 and the
Rouge license.

Rouge may already include support for Logtalk. You can check it by running
the command:

	$ rougify list

Recent versions of Rouge may already contain support for Logtalk. However, 
this directory may contain updated support files. If that is the case,
install the Logtalk support files by performing the following steps:

1. Copy the file `lib/rouge/lexers/logtalk.rb` to the same directory in 
your Rouge installation directory (replacing any existing older file).

2. Copy the file `lib/rouge/demos/logtalk` to the same directory in 
your Rouge installation directory (replacing any existing older file).

3. Copy the file `spec/lexers/logtalk_spec.rb` to the same directory in 
your Rouge installation directory (if it exists, replacing any existing
older file).

4. Copy the file `spec/visual/samples/logtalk` to the same directory in 
your Rouge installation directory (if it exists, replacing any existing
older file).

An example of generating HTML code (wrapped with a `pre` tag) would be:

	$ rougify highlight -f html -i source.lgt > source.html

To get the CSS file used for the generated HTML code use the command:

	$ rougify style > source.css

An useful formatter option is line numbers:

	$ rougify highlight -f html -F line_numbers=true -i source.lgt > source.html

You may also use the Logtalk lexer with plain Prolog files by using the `-l` 
option. For example:

	$ rougify highlight -l logtalk -i source.pl > source.html
