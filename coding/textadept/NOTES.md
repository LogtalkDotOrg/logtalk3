Textadept is a multiple platform text editor available from:

	https://foicica.com/textadept/

Textadept includes a lexer for Logtalk written by Michael T. Richter. See
the `lexers/logtalk.lua` file in the Textadept installation for details.
Replace it with the `logtalk.lua` file in this directory if more recent.

Logtalk source files (including the library entities and the programming
examples) are formatted using tabs (the recommended setting is a tab width
equivalent to 4 spaces); you may set the tab width on the editor preference
panel.
