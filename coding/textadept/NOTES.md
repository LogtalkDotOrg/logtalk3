Textadept is a multiple platform text editor available from:

	https://foicica.com/textadept/

Textadept includes a lexer for Logtalk written by Michael T. Richter.
To install, copy the `logtalk.lua` and `prolog.lua` files to the `lexers`
directory on your Textadept installation if more recent. These files
require Textadept 10.0 or a later version.

The `prolog.lua` file is included as the Logtalk lexer extends the Prolog
lexer, which required some fixes.

Logtalk source files (including the library entities and the programming
examples) are indented using tabs and are expected to remain perfectly 
indented no matter your tab width preference (a common setting is a tab
width equivalent to 4 spaces).
