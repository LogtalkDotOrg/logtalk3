This directory contains files that provide support for using version 9.12.0
or later of highlight.js with Logtalk source files. A detailed description
of highlight.js is available from:

	https://highlightjs.org/

These support files are licensed under the highlight.js license.

Recent versions of highlight.js may already contain support for Logtalk.
However, this directory may contain updated support files. If that is the
case, install the Logtalk support files by performing the following steps:

1. Copy the file `logtalk.js` to the `src/languages` sub-directory in 
your highlight.js source distribution (replacing any existing older file).

2. Copy the folder `logtalk` to the `test/detect` sub-directory in your
highlight.js source distribution (replacing any existing older folder).

3. Build a new `highlight.pack.js` file for use in your web pages. For
example, assuming that you are only highlighting Logtalk code, run the
following shell command from the root of the source distribution:

	$ node tools/build.js -n logtalk

The new `highlight.pack.js` file will be created in the `build` folder.
See the highlight.js for detailed build instructions. The `source.html`
can be used to test the build.
