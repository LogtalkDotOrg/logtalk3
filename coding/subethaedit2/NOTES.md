This directory contains the Logtalk.mode bundle, which provides syntax 
highlighting, code folding, code completion, and entity index for editing
Logtalk source files with the SubEthaEdit 2.x text editor:

	http://www.codingmonkeys.de/subethaedit/

To install copy the bundle "Logtalk.mode" to one of the following 
folders:

	~/Library/Application Support/SubEthaEdit/Modes/
	/Library/Application Support/SubEthaEdit/Modes/
	/Network/Library/Application Support/SubEthaEdit/Modes/

(create the chosen folder if it does not exist).

Logtalk source files (including the library entities and the programming
examples) are indented using tabs and are expected to remain perfectly 
indented no matter your tab width preference (a common setting is a tab
width equivalent to 4 spaces).
