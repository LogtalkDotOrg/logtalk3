This directory contains a sample `editorconfig` file that can be used for
consistent coding styles across text editors and for consistent display of
source files by services providers like GitHub. For details, see:

To use the sample file, copy it to a file named `.editorconfig` at the root
of your project or repository, and edit it for your preferences.

The `.editorconfig` settings for Logtalk source files follow the coding
style guidelines recommendations at:
