This directory contains files that provide support for code folding and 
syntax highlighting for editing Logtalk source files with the KDE Kate 
and KWrite text editors (http://kate.kde.org/) and with the KDevelop IDE 
(http://www.kdevelop.org/).

These support files are dual-licensed under the Apache License 2.0 and the
KDE license.

To install copy the file `logtalk.xml` to one of the directories:

    KDE3:	$KDEDIR/share/apps/katepart/syntax/
    KDE4:	$KDEDIR/share/kde4/apps/katepart/syntax/

or:
    
    KDE3:	~/.kde/share/apps/katepart/syntax/
    KDE4:	~/.kde/share/kde4/apps/katepart/syntax/

and restart Kate and KWrite. Logtalk source files (including the library
entities and the programming examples) are formatted using tabs (with a
width equivalent to 4 spaces); you may set the tab width on the editor
preference panel.
