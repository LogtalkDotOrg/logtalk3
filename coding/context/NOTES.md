This directory contains files that provides basic syntax coloring for 
editing Logtalk source files with the text editor Context 0.98.3 or 
later version:

	http://www.context.cx/

To install copy the file "Logtalk.chl" to the Highlighters folder of 
your ConTEXT folder (e.g. C:\Program Files\ConTEXT\Highlighters). If 
ConTEXT is running, restart it to update its list of highlighters.


THESE SYNTAX COLORING SUPPORT FILES ARE UNDER DEVELOPMENT.
