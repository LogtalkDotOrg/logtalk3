CodeMirror is an embeddable code editor written in JavaScript available from:

	https://codemirror.net/

In order to use CodeMirror for editing Logtalk source files, copy (or update
if already present) the files `logtalk.js` and `index.html` to a `mode/logtalk`
sub-directory of your CodeMirror installation directory. The `logtalk.js` file
implements the mode while the `index.html` shows a usage example.

The supporting files are work in progress, currently providing code folding,
code completion (using words in the document), and syntax highlighting. The
files were obtained by converting the Logtalk Ace mode using the `ace2cm`
converter (and replacing `storage` by `meta` in the token types in the regular
expressions):

The `logtalk.js` and `index.html` files are licensed under the MIT license
as other CodeMirror mode files.

Supported themes must define CSS styles for `meta` and `variable`. Examples
are `ambiance`, `blackboard`, `erlang-dark`, `lesser-dark`, and `mdn-like`.
