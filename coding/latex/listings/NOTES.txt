This folder contains a simple Logtalk language definition for the LaTeX
package `listings`:

	http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/listings/

To use the language definition copy the `lstlang0.sty` to the same
folder where you have the LaTeX source files that you're typesetting
and add the following lines to your main LaTeX file:

	\usepackage{listings}
	\usepackage{textcomp}

The `textcomp` package is required as the Logtalk language definition
sets the `upquote` option to true.

If you want keywords in bold face in the code listings, you will also
need to use fonts that support that face. You can use e.g. *one* of the
following font packages:

	\usepackage[scaled=0.8]{couriers}
	\usepackage{pxfonts}
	\usepackage{lmodern}
	\usepackage{txfonts}

Default options for all code listings can be set using something like:

	\lstset{
		language=Logtalk,
		basicstyle=\small\ttfamily,
		keywordstyle=\bfseries,
		tabsize=4,
		numbers=none, numberstyle=\tiny, stepnumber=1, numbersep=5pt,
		showspaces=false, showstringspaces=false,
		captionpos=b,
		frame=lines,
		upquote=true,
		framextopmargin=6pt, framexbottommargin=6pt,
		aboveskip=\medskipamount, lineskip={-2.0pt}
	}

If you need to highlight additional keywords, you can always use the
`morekeywords` option as an alternative to edit the `lstlang0.sty`
file. For example:

	morekeywords={extends_object, implements_protocol}

For inline code use `\lstinline{...}` and for code blocks use:

	\begin{lstlisting}[language=Logtalk, ...]
		...
	\end{lstlisting}

Consult the `listings` package documentation (e.g. by running the command
`texdoc listings`) and experiment with the above settings to get the exact
appearance that your publication requires.
