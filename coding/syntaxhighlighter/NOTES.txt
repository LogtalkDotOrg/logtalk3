This directory contains files that provide support for using version 3.0.83 
or later of the SyntaxHighlighter package by Alex Gorbatchev with Logtalk 
source files. A detailed description on the SyntaxHighlighter package is 
available from:

	http://alexgorbatchev.com/SyntaxHighlighter/

These support files are dual-licensed under the Apache License 2.0 and the
SyntaxHighlighter license.

In order to check if your SyntaxHighlighter distribution already includes 
support for Logtalk, look for a file named `shBrushLogtalk.js` in the
`scripts` folder. If support for Logtalk is not included or if it is
outdated, copy the file `shBrushLogtalk.js` to the `scripts` folder.

The file `source.html` is a test file based on the `../tests/source.lgt`
file. In order to use this test file, copy the referenced SyntaxHighlighter
files (`shCore.js`, `shCore.css`, and `shThemeEclipse.css`) to the same
directory and open it in your favorite web browser.
