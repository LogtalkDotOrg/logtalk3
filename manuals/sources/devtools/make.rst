``make``
========

Logtalk provides a make tool supporting several targets using the
``logtalk_make/0-1`` built-in predicates. Top-level shortcuts for the
targets are also provided.

API documentation
-----------------

To consult the documentation of the ``logtalk_make/0-1`` built-in
predicates, open in a web browser the links:

-  `../refman/predicates/logtalk_make_0.html <../refman/predicates/logtalk_make_0.html>`__
-  `../refman/predicates/logtalk_make_1.html <../refman/predicates/logtalk_make_1.html>`__

There is also a user-defined hook predicate that supports defining
additional actions for the make targets (e.g. running tests
automatically on make check or regenerating API documentation on make
documentation):
