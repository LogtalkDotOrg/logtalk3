``make``
========

Logtalk provides a make tool supporting several targets using the
``logtalk_make/0-1`` built-in predicates. Top-level shortcuts for the
targets are also provided.

predicates, open in a web browser the links:

-  `manuals/refman/predicates/logtalk_make_1.html <https://logtalk.org/manuals/refman/predicates/logtalk_make_1.html>`__

There is also a user-defined hook predicate that supports defining
additional actions for the make targets (e.g. running tests
automatically on make check):
