This PDDL 3.0 file parser converts PDDL files to Logtalk/Prolog friendly
syntax. For example:

::

   PDDL         Prolog 
   (on ?x ?y)   on(?x, ?y)

Syntax sugar: op(200, fy, ?).

For whole example check the "pddl.lgt" file for usage and example
output.

API documentation
-----------------

Open the
`../../docs/library_index.html#pddl_parser <../../docs/library_index.html#pddl_parser>`__
link in a web browser.

Loading
-------

To load all entities in this library, load the ``loader.lgt`` file:

::

   ?- logtalk_load(pddl_parser(loader)).

Testing
-------

The provided unit tests are based on a collection of problemset files
from International Planning Competition 2008. In order to run all unit
tests from the parser's directory type:

::

   ?- logtalk_load(tester).

Or from any directory by typing:

::

   ?- logtalk_load(pddl_parser(tester)).

Some of the unit tests fail in some Prolog compilers due to limitations
to the maximum arity of a term.
