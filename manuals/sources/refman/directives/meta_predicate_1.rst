``meta_predicate/1``
====================

Description
-----------

::

   meta_predicate(Template)
   meta_predicate((Template, ...))
   meta_predicate([Template, ...])

   meta_predicate(Entity::Template)
   meta_predicate((Entity::Template, ...))
   meta_predicate([Entity::Template, ...])

   meta_predicate(Module:Template)
   meta_predicate((Module:Template, ...))
   meta_predicate([Module:Template, ...])

Declares meta-predicates, i.e., predicates that have arguments that will
be called as goals. An argument may also be a :term:`closure` instead of a
goal if the meta-predicate uses the :ref:`methods_call_N` Logtalk built-in
methods to construct and call the actual goal from the closure and the
additional arguments.

Meta-arguments which are goals are represented by the integer ``0``.
Meta-arguments which are closures are represented by a positive integer,
``N``, representing the number of additional arguments that will be
appended to the closure in order to construct the corresponding meta-call.
Meta-arguments that will be called using the ``bagof/3`` or ``setof/3``
predicates and that can thus be existentially-qualified are represented
by the atom ``^``. Normal arguments are represented by the atom ``*``.
Meta-arguments are always called in the meta-predicate
:term:`calling context <predicate calling context>`, not in the
meta-predicate :term:`definition context <predicate definition context>`.

Logtalk allows the use of this directive to override the original
meta-predicate directive. This is sometimes necessary when calling
Prolog built-in meta-predicates or Prolog module meta-predicates due
to the lack of standardization of the syntax of the meta-predicate
templates.

.. warning::

   Some backend Prolog compilers declare the atom ``meta_predicate`` as
   an operator for a lighter syntax. But this makes the code non-portable
   and is therefore a practice best avoided.

Template and modes
------------------

::

   meta_predicate(+meta_predicate_template_term)

   meta_predicate(+object_identifier::+meta_predicate_template_term)
   meta_predicate(+category_identifier::+meta_predicate_template_term)

   meta_predicate(+module_identifier:+meta_predicate_template_term)

Examples
--------

::

   % findall/3 second argument is interpreted as a goal:
   :- meta_predicate(findall(*, 0, *)).

   % both forall/2 arguments are interpreted as goals:
   :- meta_predicate(forall(0, 0)).

   % maplist/3 first argument is interpreted as a closure
   % that will be expanded to a goal by appending two
   % arguments:
   :- meta_predicate(maplist(2, *, *)).
