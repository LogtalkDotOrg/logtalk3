``initialization/1``
====================

Description
-----------

::

   initialization(Goal)

When used within an object, this directive defines a goal to be called after
the object has been successfully loaded into memory. When used at a global
level within a source file, this directive defines a goal to be called after
the source file is successfully compiled and loaded into memory.

The loading context can be accessed from this directive by calling the
:ref:`predicates_logtalk_load_context_2` predicate. Note that the usable
loading context keys depends on the directive scope (file or object).

Multiple initialization directives can be used in a source file or in an
object. Their goals will be called in the same order as the directives at
loading time.

.. note::

   Arbitrary goals cannot be used as directives in source files. Any
   goal that should be automatically called when a source file is loaded
   must be wrapped using this directive.

   Categories and protocols cannot contain ``initialization/1`` directives
   as the initialization goals would lack a complete
   :term:`execution context <predicate execution context>` that is only
   available for objects.

Although technically a global ``initialization/1`` directive in a source
file is a Prolog directive, calls to Logtalk built-in predicates from it
are usually compiled to improve portability, improve performance, and
provide better support for embedded applications.

.. warning::

   Some backend Prolog compilers declare the atom ``initialization`` as
   an operator for a lighter syntax. But this makes the code non-portable
   and is therefore a practice best avoided.

Template and modes
------------------

::

   initialization(@callable)

Examples
--------

::

   % call the init/0 predicate after loading the
   % source file containing the directive
   
   :- initialization(init).

::

   % print a debug message after loading a 
   % source file defining an object

   :- object(log).
   
       :- initialization(start_date).
   
       start_date :-
           os::date_time(Year, Month, Day, _, _, _, _),
           logtalk::print_message(debug, my_app, 'Starting date: ~d-~d-~d~n'+[Year,Month,Day]).
   
   :- end_object.
