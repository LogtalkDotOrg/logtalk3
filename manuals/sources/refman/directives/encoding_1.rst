Description
-----------

::

   encoding(Encoding)

Declares the source file text encoding. Requires a :term:`backend Prolog compiler`
supporting the chosen encoding. When used, this directive must be the first
term in the source file in the first line.

The encoding used in a source file (and, in the case of a Unicode
encoding, any BOM present) will be used for the intermediate Prolog
file generated by the compiler. Logtalk uses the encoding names specified by
`IANA <http://www.iana.org/assignments/character-sets/character-sets.xhtml>`_.
In those cases where a preferred MIME name alias is specified, the alias is
used instead. Examples includes ``'US-ASCII'``, ``'ISO-8859-1'``,
``'ISO-8859-2'``, ``'ISO-8859-15'``, ``'UCS-2'``, ``'UCS-2LE'``,
``'UCS-2BE'``, ``'UTF-8'``, ``'UTF-16'``, ``'UTF-16LE'``, ``'UTF-16BE'``,
``'UTF-32'``, ``'UTF-32LE'``, ``'UTF-32BE'``, ``'Shift_JIS'``, and
``'EUC-JP'``. When writing portable code that cannot be expressed using
ASCII, ``'UTF-8'`` is the most commonly supported encoding.

The backend Prolog compiler adapter files define a table that translates
between the Logtalk and Prolog specific atoms that represent each supported
encoding.
