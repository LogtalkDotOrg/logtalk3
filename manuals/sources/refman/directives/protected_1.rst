.. _directives_protected_1:

``protected/1``
===============

Description
-----------

::

   protected(Name/Arity)
   protected((Name/Arity, ...))
   protected([Name/Arity, ...])

   protected(Name//Arity)
   protected((Name//Arity, ...))
   protected([Name//Arity, ...])

   protected(op(Precedence,Associativity,Operator))
   protected((op(Precedence,Associativity,Operator), ...))
   protected([op(Precedence,Associativity,Operator), ...])

Declares protected predicates, protected grammar rule non-terminals, and
protected operators. A protected predicate can only be called from the
object containing the directive or from an object that inherits the
directive. A protected non-terminal can only be used as an argument in a
:ref:`methods_phrase_2` and :ref:`methods_phrase_3` calls from the object
containing the directive or from an object that inherits the directive.

.. note::

   Protected operators are not inherited but declaring them provides
   a reusable specification for using them in descendant objects (or
   categories).

Template and modes
------------------

::

   protected(+predicate_indicator_term)
   protected(+non_terminal_indicator_term)
   protected(+operator_declaration)

Examples
--------

::

   :- protected(init/1).

   :- protected((print/2, convert/4)).

   :- protected([load/1, save/3]).
