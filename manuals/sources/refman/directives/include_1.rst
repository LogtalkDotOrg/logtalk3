``include/1``
=============

Description
-----------

::

   include(File)

Includes a file contents, which must be valid terms, at the place of
occurrence of the directive. The file can be specified as a relative
path, an absolute path, or using :term:`library notation` and is expanded
as a source file name. Relative paths are interpreted as relative to the
path of the file containing the directive. The file extension is optional.

When using the :ref:`reflection API <reflection_reflection>`, predicates
from an included file can be distinguished from predicates from the main
file by looking for the ``include/1`` predicate declaration property or
the ``include/1`` predicate definition property. For the included predicates,
the ``line_count/1`` property stores the term line number in the included file.

This directive can be used as either a source file directive or an
entity directive. As an entity directive, it can be used both in
entities defined in source files and with the entity creation built-in
predicates. In the latter case, the file should be specified using an
absolute path or using library notation (which expands to a full path)
to avoid a fragile dependency on the current working directory.

Included files may contain an :ref:`directives_encoding_1` directive, which
may specify the same encoding of the main file or a different encoding.

.. warning::

   When using this directive as an argument in calls to the
   :ref:`predicates_create_object_4` and :ref:`predicates_create_category_4`
   predicates, the objects and categories will not be recreated or redefined
   when the included file(s) are modified and the :ref:`predicates_logtalk_make_0`
   predicate or the :ref:`predicates_logtalk_make_1` (with target ``all``)
   predicates are called.

Template and modes
------------------

::

   include(@source_file_name)

Examples
--------

::

   % include the "raw_1.txt" text file found
   % on the "data" library directory:
   :- include(data('raw_1.txt')).

   % include a "factbase.pl" file in the same directory
   % of the source file containing the directive:
   :- include('factbase.pl').

   % include a file given its absolute path:
   :- include('/home/me/databases/countries.pl').

   % create a wrapper object for a Prolog file using
   % library notation to define the file path:
   | ?- create_object(cities, [], [public(city/4), include(geo('cities.pl'))], []).
