``self/1``
==========

Description
-----------

::

   self(Self)

Returns the object that has received the message under processing. This
private method is translated to a unification between its argument and
the corresponding implicit context argument in the predicate clause making
the call. This unification occurs at the clause head when the argument
is not instantiated (the most common case).

Modes and number of proofs
--------------------------

::

   self(?object_identifier) - zero_or_one

Errors
------

(none)

Examples
--------

::

   % upon compilation, the write/1 call will be
   % the first goal on the clause body
   test :-
       self(Self),
       write('executing a method in behalf of '),
       writeq(Self), nl.
