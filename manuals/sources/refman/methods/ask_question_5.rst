``ask_question/5``
==================

Description
-----------

::

   ask_question(Question, Kind, Component, Check, Answer)

Built-in method for asking a question represented by a term,
``Question``, which is converted to the question text using the
:ref:`logtalk::message_tokens(Question, Component) <methods_message_tokens_2>`
hook predicate. This method is declared in the ``logtalk`` built-in
object as a public predicate. The default question prompt and the input
stream used for each ``Kind-Component`` pair can be found using the
:ref:`logtalk::question_prompt_stream(Kind, Component, Prompt, Stream) <methods_question_prompt_stream_4>`
hook predicate. The ``Check`` argument is a :term:`closure` that is converted
into a checking goal by extending it with the user supplied answer. This
predicate implements a read-loop that terminates when the checking
predicate succeeds.

This predicate starts by calling the
:ref:`logtalk::question_hook(Question, Kind, Component, Check, Answer) <methods_question_hook_6>`
hook predicate. If this predicate succeeds, the ``ask_question/5``
predicate assumes that the question have been successfully asked and
replied.
