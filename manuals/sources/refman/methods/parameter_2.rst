``parameter/2``
===============

Description
-----------

::

   parameter(Number, Term)

Used in :term:`parametric objects <parametric entity>` (and
parametric categories), this private method provides runtime access to
the parameter values of the entity that contains the predicate clause
whose body is being executed by using the argument number in the entity
identifier. This predicate is implemented as a unification between its
second argument and the corresponding implicit execution-context
argument in the predicate clause making the call. This unification
occurs at the clause head when the second argument is not instantiated
(the most common case). When the second argument is instantiated, the
unification must be delayed to runtime and thus occurs at the clause
body.

Entity parameters can also be accessed using *parameter variables*,
which use the syntax ``_VariableName_``. The compiler recognizes
occurrences of these variables in directives and clauses. Parameter
variables allows us to abstract parameter positions thus simplifying
code maintenance.

Modes and number of proofs
--------------------------

::

   parameter(+integer, ?term) - zero_or_one

Errors
------

| ``Number`` is a variable:
|     ``instantiation_error``
| ``Number`` is neither a variable nor an integer value:
|     ``type_error(integer, Number)``
| ``Number`` is smaller than one or greater than the parametric entity identifier arity:
|     ``domain_error(out_of_range, Number)``
| ``Entity`` identifier is not a compound term:
|     ``type_error(compound, Entity)``

Examples
--------

::

   :- object(box(_Color, _Weight)).

       ...
       
       % this clause is translated into
       % a fact upon compilation
       color(Color) :-
           parameter(1, Color).
       
       % upon compilation, the >/2 call will be
       % the single goal in the clause body
       heavy :-
           parameter(2, Weight),
           Weight > 10.
       ...

The same example using *parameter variables*:

::

   :- object(box(_Color_, _Weight_)).

       ...
       
       color(_Color_).

       heavy :-
           _Weight_ > 10.

       ...
