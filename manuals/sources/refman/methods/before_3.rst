``before/3``
============

Description
-----------

::

   before(Object, Message, Sender)

User-defined method for handling *before* events. This method is
declared in the :ref:`monitoring <apis:monitoring/0>` built-in protocol
as a public predicate and automatically called by the runtime for messages
sent using the :ref:`control_send_to_object_2` control construct from within
objects compiled with the :ref:`events <flag_events>` flag set to ``allow``.

Note that you can make this predicate scope protected or private by using,
respectively, :ref:`protected or private implementation <inheritance_scope>`
of the ``monitoring`` protocol.

Modes and number of proofs
--------------------------

::

   before(?object_identifier, ?callable, ?object_identifier) - zero_or_more

Errors
------

(none)

Examples
--------

::

   :- object(...,
       implements(monitoring),
       ...).

       % write a log message when a message is sent:
       before(Object, Message, Sender) :-
           writeq(Object), write('::'), writeq(Message),
           write(' from '), writeq(Sender), nl.
