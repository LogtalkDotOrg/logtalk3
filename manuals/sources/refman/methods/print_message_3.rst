===================

Description
-----------

::

   print_message(Kind, Component, Term)

Built-in method for printing a message represented by a term, which is
converted to the message text using the
:ref:`logtalk::message_tokens(Term, Component) <methods_message_tokens_2>`
hook non-terminal. This method is declared in the
:ref:`logtalk <apis:logtalk/0>` built-in
object as a public predicate. The line prefix and the output stream used
for each ``Kind-Component`` pair can be found using the
:ref:`logtalk::message_prefix_stream(Kind, Component, Prefix, Stream) <methods_message_prefix_stream_4>`
hook predicate.

This predicate starts by converting the message term to a list of tokens
and by calling the
:ref:`logtalk::message_hook(Message, Kind, Component, Tokens) <methods_message_hook_4>`
hook predicate. If this predicate succeeds, the ``print_message/3``
predicate assumes that the message have been successfully printed.

By default: messages of kind ``debug`` or ``debug(_)`` are only printed when
the ``debug`` flag is turned on; messages of kind ``banner``, ``comment``, or
``comment(_)`` are only printed when the ``report`` flag is set to ``on``;
messages of kind ``warning`` and ``warning(_)`` are not printed when the
``report`` flag is set to ``off``; messages of kind ``silent`` and ``silent()``
are not printed (but can be intercepted).
