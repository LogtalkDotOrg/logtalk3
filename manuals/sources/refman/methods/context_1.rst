``context/1``
=============

Description
-----------

::

   context(Context)

Returns the execution context for a predicate clause using the term
``logtalk(Head,ExecutionContext)`` where ``Head`` is the head of the
clause containing the call. This private predicate is mainly used for
providing a default error context when type-checking predicate
arguments. The ``ExecutionContext`` term should be regarded as an opaque
term, which can be decoded using the
:ref:`logtalk::execution_context/7 <apis:logtalk/0::execution_context/7>`
predicate. Calls to this predicate are inlined at compilation time.

Modes and number of proofs
--------------------------

::

   context(--callable) - one

Errors
------

| ``Context`` is not a variable:
|     ``type_error(var, Context)``

Examples
--------

::

   foo(A, N) :-
       % type-check arguments
       context(Context),
       type::check(atom, A, Context),
       type::check(integer, N, Context),
       % arguments are fine; go ahead
       ... .
