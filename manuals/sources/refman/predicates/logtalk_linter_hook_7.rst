=========================

Description
-----------

::

   logtalk_linter_hook(Goal, Flag, File, Lines, Type, Entity, Warning)

Multifile user-defined predicate, supporting the definition of custom linter
warnings. Experimental. The ``Goal`` argument can be a message sending goal,
``Object::Message``, a call to a Prolog built-in predicate, or a call to a
module predicate, ``Module:Predicate``. The ``Flag`` argument must be a
supported linter flag. The ``Warning`` argument must be a valid ``core``
message term.


Modes and number of proofs
--------------------------

::

   logtalk_linter_hook(@callable, +atom, +atom, +pair(integer), +atom, @object_identifier, --callable) - zero_or_more

Errors
------

(none)

Examples
--------

::

   :- multifile(user::logtalk_linter_hook/7).
   % warn about using list::append/3 to construct a list from an head and a tail
   user::logtalk_linter_hook(
       list::append(L1,L2,L), suspicious_calls,
       File, Lines, Type, Entity,
       suspicious_call(File, Lines, Type, Entity, list::append(L1,L2,L), [L=[Head|L2]])
   ) :-
       nonvar(L1),
       L1 = [Head].
