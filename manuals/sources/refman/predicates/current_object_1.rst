``current_object/1``
====================

Description
-----------

::

   current_object(Object)

Enumerates, by backtracking, all currently defined objects. All objects
are found, either static, dynamic or built-in.

Modes and number of proofs
--------------------------

::

   current_object(?object_identifier) - zero_or_more

Errors
------

| ``Object`` is neither a variable nor a valid object identifier:
|     ``type_error(object_identifier, Object)``

Examples
--------

::

   % enumerate the defined objects:
   | ?- current_object(Object).
   
   Object = user ;
   Object = logtalk ;
