``object_property/2``
=====================

Description
-----------

::

   object_property(Object, Property)

Enumerates, by backtracking, the properties associated with the defined
objects. The valid properties are listed in the language grammar section
on :ref:`entity properties <grammar_entity_properties>` and described in
the User Manual section on :ref:`object properties <objects_properties>`.

Modes and number of proofs
--------------------------

::

   object_property(?object_identifier, ?object_property) - zero_or_more

Errors
------

| ``Object`` is neither a variable nor a valid object identifier:
|     ``type_error(object_identifier, Object)``
| ``Property`` is neither a variable nor a callable term:
|     ``type_error(callable, Property)``
| ``Property`` is a callable term but not a valid object property:
|     ``domain_error(object_property, Property)``

Examples
--------

::

   % enumerate the properties of the logtalk built-in object:
   | ?- object_property(logtalk, Property).

   Property = context_switching_calls ;
   Property = source_data ;
   Property = threaded ;
   Property = static ;
   Property = built_in ;
