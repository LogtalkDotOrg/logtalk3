``threaded_engine_self/1``
==========================

Description
-----------

::

   threaded_engine_self(Engine)

Queries the name of engine calling the predicate.

.. note::

   This predicate requires a :term:`backend Prolog compiler` providing

   :ref:`engines <flag_engines>` flag is set to ``supported`` when that
   is the case.

Modes and number of proofs
--------------------------

::

   threaded_engine_self(?nonvar) - zero_or_one

Errors
------

(none)

Examples
--------

::

   % find the name of the engine making the query:
   ..., threaded_engine_self(Engine), ...

   % check if the the engine making the query is worker_1:
   ..., threaded_engine_self(worker_1), ...
