**built-in predicate**

.. index:: pair: logtalk_compile/2; Built-in predicate
.. _predicates_logtalk_compile_2:

``logtalk_compile/2``
=====================

Description
-----------

::

   logtalk_compile(File, Flags)
   logtalk_compile(Files, Flags)

Compiles to disk a :term:`source file` or a list of source files using a
list of compiler flags. The Logtalk source file name extension (by default,
``.lgt``) can be omitted. Source file paths can be absolute, relative to
the current directory, or use :term:`library notation`. This predicate can
also be used to compile Prolog source files as Logtalk source code. When no
recognized Logtalk or Prolog extension is specified, the compiler tries
first to append a Logtalk source file extension and then a Prolog source
file extension. If that fails, the compiler tries to use the file name
as-is. Compiler flags are represented as *flag(value)*. For a description
of the available compiler flags, please see the :ref:`programming_flags`
section in the User Manual. The recognized Logtalk and Prolog file
extensions are defined in the :term:`backend adapter files <adapter file>`.

.. note::

   This predicate does not load into memory the compiled source file.
   If you want to both compile and load a source file, use instead the
   :ref:`predicates_logtalk_load_2` built-in predicate.

When this predicate is called from the top-level interpreter, relative source
file paths are resolved using the current working directory. When the calls
are made from a source file, relative source file paths are resolved by
default using the source file directory (unless a
:ref:`relative_to <flag_relative_to>` flag is passed).

Note that only the errors related to problems in the predicate argument
are listed below. This predicate fails on the first error found during
compilation of a source file. In this case, no file with the compiled
code is written to disk.

.. warning::

   The compiler flags specified in the second argument only apply to the
   files listed in the first argument. Notably, if you are compiling a
   :term:`loader file`, the flags only apply to the loader file itself.

Modes and number of proofs

Errors
------

| ``File`` is a variable:
|     ``instantiation_error``
| ``Files`` is a variable or a list with an element which is a variable:
|     ``instantiation_error``
| ``File``, or an element ``File`` of the ``Files`` list, is neither a variable nor a source file name:
|     ``type_error(source_file_name, File)``
| ``File``, or an element ``File`` of the ``Files`` list, uses library notation but the library does not exist:
|     ``existence_error(library, Library)``
| ``File`` or an element ``File`` of the ``Files`` list, does not exist:
|     ``existence_error(file, File)``
|
| ``Flags`` is a variable or a list with an element which is a variable:
|     ``instantiation_error``
| ``Flags`` is neither a variable nor a proper list:
|     ``type_error(list, Flags)``
| An element ``Flag`` of the ``Flags`` list is not a valid compiler flag:
|     ``type_error(compiler_flag, Flag)``
| An element ``Flag`` of the ``Flags`` list defines a value for a read-only compiler flag:
|     ``permission_error(modify, flag, Flag)``
| An element ``Flag`` of the ``Flags`` list defines an invalid value for a flag:
|     ``domain_error(flag_value, Flag+Value)``

Examples
--------

::

   % compile to disk the "list" source file in the
   % current directory using default compiler flags:
   | ?- logtalk_compile(list, []).

   % compile to disk the "tree" source file in the "types"
   % library directory with the source_data flag turned on:
   | ?- logtalk_compile(types(tree), [source_data(on)]).

   % compile to disk the "file_system" source file in the
   % current directory with portability warnings suppressed:
   | ?- logtalk_compile(file_system, [portability(silent)]).
