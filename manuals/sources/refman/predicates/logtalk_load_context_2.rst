``logtalk_load_context/2``
==========================

Description
-----------

::

   logtalk_load_context(Key, Value)

Provides access to the Logtalk compilation/loading context. The following keys
are currently supported:

* ``entity_identifier`` - identifier of the entity being compiled if any
* ``entity_prefix`` - internal prefix for the entity compiled code
* ``entity_type`` - returns the value ``module`` when compiling a module as an object
* ``source`` - full path of the source file being compiled
* ``file`` - the actual file being compiled, different from ``source`` only when processing an ``include/1`` directive
* ``basename`` - source file basename
* ``directory`` - source file directory
* ``stream`` - input stream being used to read source file terms
* ``target`` - the full path of the intermediate Prolog file
* ``flags`` - the list of the explicit flags used for the compilation of the source file
* ``term`` - the source file term being compiled
* ``term_position`` - the position of the term being compiled (``StartLine-EndLine``)
* ``variables`` - the variables of the term being compiled (``[Variable1, ...]``)
* ``variable_names`` - the variable names of the term being compiled (``[Name1=Variable1, ...]``)
* ``variable_names(Term)`` - the variable names of the term being compiled (``[Name1=Variable1, ...]``)
* ``singletons`` - the singleton variables of the term being compiled (``[Name1=Variable1, ...]``)
* ``singletons(Term)`` - the singleton variables of the term being compiled (``[Name1=Variable1, ...]``)
* ``parameter_variables`` - list of parameter variable names and positions (``[Name1-Position1, ...]``)

Calling this predicate with the ``parameter_variables`` key only succeeds
when compiling a parametric entity containing parameter variables.

This predicate is usually called by the :ref:`methods_term_expansion_2`
and :ref:`methods_goal_expansion_2` methods. It can also be called directly
from :ref:`directives_initialization_1` directives in a source file. Note
that the entity keys are only available when compiling an entity term or
from an object ``initialization/1`` directive.

.. warning::

   The ``term_position`` key is only supported in
   :term:`backend Prolog compilers <backend Prolog compiler>`
   that provide access to the start and end lines of a read term. When
   such support is not available, the value ``-1`` is returned for both
   the start and the end lines.

   Variables in the values of the ``term``, ``variables``, ``variable_names``,
   and ``singletons`` keys are not shared with, respectively, the term and
   goal arguments of the ``term_expansion/2`` and ``goal_expansion/2`` methods.
   Use instead the ``variable_names(Term)`` and ``singletons(Term)`` keys.

Examples

::

   % expand source file terms only if they are entity terms
   term_expansion(Term, ExpandedTerms) :-
       logtalk_load_context(entity_identifier, _),
       ....

   % expand source file term while accessing its variable names
   term_expansion(Term, ExpandedTerms) :-
       logtalk_load_context(variable_names(Term), VariableNames),
       ....

   % define a library alias based on the source directory
   :- initialization((
       logtalk_load_context(directory, Directory),
       assertz(logtalk_library_path(my_app, Directory))
   )).
