``logtalk_load_context/2``
==========================

Description
-----------

::

   logtalk_load_context(Key, Value)

Provides access to the Logtalk compilation/loading context. The
following keys are currently supported:

* ``entity_identifier`` - identifier of the entity being compiled if any
* ``entity_prefix`` - internal prefix for the entity compiled code
* ``entity_type`` - returns the value ``module`` when compiling a module as an object
* ``source`` - full path of the source file being compiled
* ``file`` - the actual file being compiled, different from ``source`` only when processing an ``include/1`` directive
* ``basename`` - source file basename
* ``directory`` - source file directory
* ``stream`` - input stream being used to read source file terms
* ``target`` - the full path of the intermediate Prolog file
* ``flags`` - the list of the explicit flags used for the compilation of the source file
* ``term`` - the source file term being compiled
* ``term_position`` - the position of the term being compiled (``StartLine-EndLine``)
* ``variables`` - the variables of the term being compiled (``[Variable1, ...]``)
* ``variable_names`` - the variable names of the term being compiled (``[Name1=Variable1, ...]``)
* ``singletons`` - the singleton variables of the term being compiled (``[Name1=Variable1, ...]``)

This predicate is usually called by the :ref:`methods_term_expansion_2`
and :ref:`methods_goal_expansion_2` methods. It can also be called directly
from :ref:`directives_initialization_1` directives in a source file. Note
that the entity keys are only available when compiling an entity term or
from an object ``initialization/1`` directive.

.. warning::

   The ``term_position`` key is only supported in
   :term:`backend Prolog compilers <backend Prolog compiler>`
   that provide access to the start and end lines of a read term. When
   such support is not available, the value ``-1`` is returned for both
   the start and the end lines.

   Currently, any variables in the values of the ``term``, ``variables``,
   ``variable_names``, and ``singletons`` keys are not shared with,
   respectively, the term and goal arguments of the ``term_expansion/2``
   and ``goal_expansion/2`` methods.

   Using the ``variables``, ``variable_names``, and ``singletons`` keys
   may require calling the standard built-in predicate ``term_variables/2``
   on the term read and unifying the term variables with the variables
   in the names list. This, however, may rise portability issues with
   Prolog compilers that don't return the variables in the same order for
   the ``term_variables/2`` predicate and the option ``variable_names/1``
   of the ``read_term/3`` built-in predicate, which is used by the Logtalk
   compiler to read source files.

::

   % expand source file terms only if they are entity terms
   term_expansion(Term, ExpandedTerms) :-
       logtalk_load_context(entity_identifier, _),
       ....

   % define a library alias based on the source directory
   :- initialization((
