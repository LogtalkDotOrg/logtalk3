``extends_object/2-3``
======================

Description
-----------

::

   extends_object(Prototype, Parent)
   extends_object(Prototype, Parent, Scope)

Enumerates, by backtracking, all pairs of objects such that the first
one extends the second. The relation scope is represented by the atoms
``public``, ``protected``, and ``private``.

Modes and number of proofs
--------------------------

::

   extends_object(?object_identifier, ?object_identifier) - zero_or_more
   extends_object(?object_identifier, ?object_identifier, ?scope) - zero_or_more

Errors
------

| ``Prototype`` is neither a variable nor a valid object identifier:
|     ``type_error(object_identifier, Prototype)``
| ``Parent`` is neither a variable nor a valid object identifier:
|     ``type_error(object_identifier, Parent)``
| ``Scope`` is neither a variable nor an atom:
|     ``type_error(atom, Scope)``
| ``Scope`` is an atom but an invalid entity scope:
|     ``domain_error(scope, Scope)``

Examples
--------

::

   % enumerate objects derived from the state_space prototype:
   | ?- extends_object(Object, state_space).

   % enumerate objects publicly derived from the list prototype:
   | ?- extends_object(Object, list, public).
