Description
-----------

::

   logtalk_make(Target)

Runs a make target. Prints a warning message and fails when the target is
not valid.

Allows reloading all Logtalk source files that have been modified since
last loaded when called with the target ``all``, deleting all
intermediate files generated by the compilation of Logtalk source files
when called with the target ``clean``, checking for code issues when
called with the target ``check``, listing of circular dependencies
between pairs or trios of objects when called with the target
``circular``, generating documentation when called with the target
``documentation``, and deleting the :term:`dynamic binding` caches with
the target ``caches``.

There are also three variants of the ``all`` target: ``debug``,
``normal``, and ``optimal``. These targets change the compilation mode
(by changing the default value of the :ref:`debug <flag_debug>` and
:ref:`optimize <flag_optimize>` flags) and reload all affected files 
(i.e. all files loaded without an explicit ``debug/1`` or ``optimize/1``
compiler option).

When using the ``all`` target, only source files loaded using the
:ref:`predicates_logtalk_load_1` and :ref:`predicates_logtalk_load_2`
predicates are reloaded. Non-modified files will also be reloaded when
there is a change to the compilation mode (i.e. when the files were loaded
without explicit :ref:`debug <flag_debug>` or :ref:`optimize <flag_optimize>`
flags and the default values of these flags changed after loading; no check
is made, however, for other implicit compiler flags that may have changed
since loading). When an included file is modified, this target reloads its
main file (i.e. the file that contains the :ref:`directives_include_1`
directive).

When using the ``check`` or ``circular`` targets, be sure to compile
your source files with the :ref:`source_data <flag_source_data>` flag
turned on for complete and detailed reports.

The ``check`` target scans for missing entities (objects, protocols,
categories, and modules), missing entity predicates, and duplicated
library aliases. Predicates for messages sent to objects that implement
the :ref:`forwarding <apis:forwarding/0>` built-in protocol are not
reported. While this usually avoids only false positives, it may
also result in failure to report true missing predicates in some cases.

When using the ``circular`` target, be prepared for a lengthy computation
time for applications with a large combined number of objects and message
calls. Only mutual and triangular dependencies are checked due to the
computational cost. Circular dependencies occur when an object sends a
message to a second object that, in turn, sends a message to the first
object. These circular dependencies are often a consequence of lack of
separation of concerns. But, when they cannot be fixed, the only practical
consequence is a small performance cost as some of the messages would be
forced to use dynamic binding.

The ``documentation`` target requires the ``doclet`` tool and a single
:term:`doclet object` to be loaded. See the ``doclet`` tool documentation
for more details.

Depending on the :term:`backend Prolog compiler`, the following top-level
shortcuts are usually defined:

* ``{*}`` - ``logtalk_make(all)``
* ``{!}`` - ``logtalk_make(clean)``
* ``{?}`` - ``logtalk_make(check)``
* ``{@}`` - ``logtalk_make(circular)``
* ``{#}`` - ``logtalk_make(documentation)``
* ``{$}`` - ``logtalk_make(caches)``
* ``{+d}`` - ``logtalk_make(debug)``
* ``{+n}`` - ``logtalk_make(normal)``
* ``{+o}`` - ``logtalk_make(optimal)``

Check the :term:`adapter files <adapter file>` for the availability of
these shortcuts as they are not part of the language.

.. warning::

   Only use the shortcuts at the top-level interpreter and
   never in source files.

The target actions can be extended by defining clauses for the multifile
and dynamic hook predicate
:ref:`logtalk_make_target_action(Target) <predicates_logtalk_make_target_action_1>`
where ``Target`` is one of the targets listed above. The additional user
defined actions are run after the default ones.
