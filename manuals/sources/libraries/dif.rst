.. _library_dif:

``dif``
=======

The ``dif`` object provides a portable abstraction over how the
``dif/2`` predicate is made available by the supported backend Prolog
systems that implement it (B-Prolog, ECLiPSe, Scryer Prolog, SICStus
Prolog, SWI-Prolog, Trealla Prolog, XSB, and YAP).

Calls to the library predicates are inlined when compiled with the
``optimize`` flag turned on. In this case, there is no overhead compared
with calling the abstracted predicates directly.
