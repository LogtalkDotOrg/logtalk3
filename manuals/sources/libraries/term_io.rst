.. _library_term_io:

``term_io``
===========

This library implements predicates for reading/writing terms from/to
atoms, chars (lists of characters), and codes (lists of character
codes). These predicates are implemented using a single temporary file
created when the library is loaded. This temporary file is unique per
Logtalk process. The predicates can be safely used in multi-threaded
applications.
