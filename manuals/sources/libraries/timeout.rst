.. _library_timeout:

``timeout``
===========

The ``timeout`` object provides a portable abstraction over calling a
goal deterministically with a time limit as made available in some form
by some of the supported backend Prolog systems (B-Prolog, ECLiPSe, LVM,
SICStus Prolog, SWI-Prolog, Trealla Prolog, XSB, and YAP).

For better performance, compile calls to this library meta-predicates
with the ``optimize`` flag turned on so that the meta-arguments, i.e.
the goals that you are timing, are also compiled.
