<h4>Description</h4>

<pre>expand_term(Term, Expansion)</pre>
<p>
Expands a term. The most common use is to expand a grammar rule into a clause. Users may override the default Logtalk grammar rule translator by defining clauses for the predicate <a href="term_expansion_2.html"><code>term_expansion/2</code></a>.
</p>
<p>
The expansion works as follows: if the first argument is a variable, then it is unified with the second argument; if the first argument is not a variable and clauses for the <code>term_expansion/2</code> predicate are within scope, then this predicate is called to provide an expansion that is then unified with the second argument; if the <code>term_expansion/2</code> predicate is not used and the first argument is a compound term with functor <code>--&gt;/2</code> then the default Logtalk grammar rule translator is used, with the resulting clause being unified with the second argument; when the translator is not used, the two arguments are unified. The <code>expand_term/2</code> predicate may return a single term or a list of terms.
</p>
<p>
This built-in method may be used to expand a grammar rule into a clause for use with the built-in database methods.
</p>
<p>
Term expansion is only performed by by Logtalk at compile time (to expand terms read from a source file). This predicate can be used by the user to perform term expansion at runtime (for example, to convert a grammar rule into a clause).
