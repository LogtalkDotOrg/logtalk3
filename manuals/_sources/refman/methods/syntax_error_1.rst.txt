``syntax_error/1``
==================

Description
-----------

::

   syntax_error(Description)

Throws a syntax error. Used when the sequence of characters being read are not
syntactically valid. This built-in method is declared private and thus cannot
be used as a message to an object. Calling this predicate is equivalent to the
following sequence of goals:

::

   ...,
   context(Context),
   throw(error(syntax_error(Description), Context)).

This allows the user to generate errors in the same format used by the
runtime.

Modes and number of proofs
