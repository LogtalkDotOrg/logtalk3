``question_hook/6``
===================

Description
-----------

::

   question_hook(Question, Kind, Component, Tokens, Check, Answer)

User-defined hook method for intercepting asking a question, declared in
the :ref:`logtalk <apis:logtalk/0>` built-in object as a public, multifile,
and dynamic predicate. This hook method is automatically called by the
:ref:`methods_ask_question_5` method. When the call
succeeds, the ``ask_question/5`` method assumes that the question have
been successfully asked and replied.

Modes and number of proofs
--------------------------

::

   question_hook(+nonvar, +nonvar, +nonvar, +list(nonvar), +callable, -term) - zero_or_one

Meta-predicate template
-----------------------

::

   question_hook(*, *, *, *, 1, *)

Errors
------

(none)

Examples
--------

::

   :- multifile(logtalk::question_hook/6).
   :- dynamic(logtalk::question_hook/6).

   % use a pre-defined answer instead of asking the user
   logtalk::question_hook(upper_limit, question, my_app, _, _, 3.7).
