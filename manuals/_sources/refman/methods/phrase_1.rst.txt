Description
-----------

::

   phrase(GrammarRuleBody)

This non-terminal takes a grammar rule body and parses it using the implicit
difference list of tokens. A common use is to wrap what otherwise would be a
:term:`naked meta-variable` in a grammar rule body.

Modes and number of proofs
--------------------------

::

   phrase(+callable) - zero_or_more

Errors
------

| ``GrammarRuleBody`` is a variable:
|     ``instantiation_error``
| ``GrammarRuleBody`` is neither a variable nor a callable term:
|     ``type_error(callable, GrammarRuleBody)``

Examples
--------
