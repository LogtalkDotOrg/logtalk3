``message_prefix_file/6``
=========================

Description
-----------

::

   message_prefix_file(Kind, Component, Prefix, File, Mode, Options)

Experimental user-defined hook method for specifying the prefix and file
for copying messages for a given kind and :term:`component`. This method
is declared in the :ref:`logtalk <apis:logtalk/0>` built-in object as a
public, multifile, and dynamic predicate. The valid values for ``Mode``
are ``write`` and ``append``. The valid options are the same as the
standard ``open/4`` predicate.

The prefix is printed for each line in the list of tokens generated by the
message tokenization (new lines are specified using the ``nl`` token; see
the documentation of the :ref:`logtalk <apis:logtalk/0>` built-in object
for details).

Modes and number of proofs
--------------------------

::

   message_prefix_file(?nonvar, ?nonvar, ?atom, ?atom, ?atom, ?list(compound)) - zero_or_more

Errors
------

(none)

Examples
--------

::

   :- multifile(logtalk::message_prefix_file/6).
   :- dynamic(logtalk::message_prefix_file/6).

   logtalk::message_prefix_file(comment, app, '% ', 'comments.txt', append, []).
