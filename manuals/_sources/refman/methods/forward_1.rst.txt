Description
-----------

::

   forward(Message)

User-defined method for forwarding unknown messages sent to an object (using
the :ref:`control_send_to_object_2` control construct), automatically called
by the runtime when defined. This method is declared in the
:ref:`forwarding <apis:forwarding/0>` built-in protocol as a
:ref:`public <directives_public_1>` predicate. Note that you can make
its scope protected or private by using, respectively, :ref:`protected or
private implementation <inheritance_scope>` of the ``forwarding`` protocol.

           [real::Message].
