**built-in method**

.. index:: pair: (\+)/1; Built-in method

``(\+)/1``
==========

Description
-----------

::

   \+ Goal

Not-provable meta-predicate. True iff ``call(Goal)`` is false. This
built-in meta-predicate is declared as a private method and thus cannot
be used as a message to an object.

Modes and number of proofs
--------------------------

::

   \+ +callable - zero_or_one

Errors
------

| ``Goal`` is a variable:
|     ``instantiation_error``
| ``Goal`` is neither a variable nor a callable term:
|     ``type_error(callable, Goal)``

Examples
--------

| Not-provable goal in the context of the object or category containing the call:
|     ``\+ Goal``
| Not-provable goal sent as a message to :term:`self`:
|     ``\+ ::Goal``
| Not-provable goal sent as a message to an explicit object:
|     ``\+ Object::Goal``
