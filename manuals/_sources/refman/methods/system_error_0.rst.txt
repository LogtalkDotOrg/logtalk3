**built-in method**

``system_error/0``
==================

Description
-----------

::

   system_error

Throws a system error. Used when runtime execution can no longer proceed. For
example, an exception is thrown without an active catcher. This built-in method
is declared private and thus cannot be used as a message to an object. Calling
this predicate is equivalent to the following sequence of goals:

::

   ...,
   context(Context),
   throw(error(system_error, Context)).

This allows the user to generate errors in the same format used by the
runtime.

Modes and number of proofs
--------------------------

::

   system_error - error
