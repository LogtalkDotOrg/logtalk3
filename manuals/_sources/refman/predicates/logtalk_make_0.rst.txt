``logtalk_make/0``
==================

Description
-----------

::

   logtalk_make

Reloads all Logtalk source files that have been modified since the time
they are last loaded. Only source files loaded using the
:ref:`predicates_logtalk_load_1` and :ref:`predicates_logtalk_load_2`
predicates are reloaded. Non-modified files will
also be reloaded when there is a change to the compilation mode (i.e.
when the files were loaded without explicit :ref:`debug <flag_debug>` or
:ref:`optimize <flag_optimize>` flags and the default values of these
flags changed after loading; no check is made, however, for other implicit
compiler flags that may have changed since loading). When an included file
is modified, this predicate reloads its main file (i.e. the file that
contains the :ref:`directives_include_1` directive).

Depending on the :term:`backend Prolog compiler`, the shortcut ``{*}`` may
be used in alternative. Check the :term:`adapter files <adapter file>` for
the availability of the shortcut as it is not part of the language.

.. warning::

   Only use the ``{*}`` shortcut at the top-level interpreter and
   never in source files.

This predicate can be extended by the user by defining clauses for the
:ref:`predicates_logtalk_make_target_action_1` multifile and dynamic hook
predicate using the argument ``all``. The additional user defined actions
are run after the default one.
