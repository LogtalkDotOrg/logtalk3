``abolish_events/5``
====================

Description
-----------

::

   abolish_events(Event, Object, Message, Sender, Monitor)

Abolishes all matching events. The two types of events are represented
by the atoms ``before`` and ``after``. When the predicate is called with
the first argument unbound, both types of events are abolished.

Modes and number of proofs
--------------------------

::

   abolish_events(@term, @term, @term, @term, @term) - one

Errors
------

| ``Event`` is neither a variable nor a valid event identifier:
|     ``type_error(event, Event)``
| ``Object`` is neither a variable nor a valid object identifier:
|     ``type_error(object_identifier, Object)``
| ``Message`` is neither a variable nor a callable term:
|     ``type_error(callable, Message)``
| ``Sender`` is neither a variable nor a valid object identifier:
|     ``type_error(object_identifier, Sender)``
| ``Monitor`` is neither a variable nor a valid object identifier:
|     ``type_error(object_identifier, Monitor)``

Examples
--------

::

   % abolish all events for messages sent to the "list"
   % object being monitored by the "debugger" object:
   | ?- abolish_events(_, list, _, _, debugger).
