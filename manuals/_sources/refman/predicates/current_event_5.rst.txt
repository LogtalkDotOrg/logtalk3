``current_event/5``
===================

Description
-----------

::

   current_event(Event, Object, Message, Sender, Monitor)

Enumerates, by backtracking, all defined events. The two types of events
are represented by the atoms ``before`` and ``after``.

Modes and number of proofs
--------------------------

::

   current_event(?event, ?term, ?term, ?term, ?object_identifier) - zero_or_more

Errors
------

| ``Event`` is neither a variable nor a valid event identifier:
|     ``type_error(event, Event)``
| ``Object`` is neither a variable nor a valid object identifier:
|     ``type_error(object_identifier, Object)``
| ``Message`` is neither a variable nor a callable term:
|     ``type_error(callable, Message)``
| ``Sender`` is neither a variable nor a valid object identifier:
|     ``type_error(object_identifier, Sender)``
| ``Monitor`` is neither a variable nor a valid object identifier:
|     ``type_error(object_identifier, Monitor)``

Examples
--------

::

   % enumerate all events monitored by the "debugger" object:
   | ?- current_event(Event, Object, Message, Sender, debugger).
