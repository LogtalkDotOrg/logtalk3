.. _predicates_threaded_engine_post_2:

``threaded_engine_post/2``
==========================

Description
-----------

::

   threaded_engine_post(Engine, Term)

Posts a term to the engine term queue.

.. note::

   This predicate requires a :term:`backend Prolog compiler` providing
   compatible multi-threading primitives. The value of the read-only
   :ref:`engines <flag_engines>` flag is set to ``supported`` when that
   is the case.

Modes and number of proofs
--------------------------

::

   threaded_engine_post(@nonvar, @term) - one

Errors
------

| ``Engine`` is a variable:
|     ``instantiation_error``
| ``Engine`` is neither a variable nor the name of an existing engine:
|     ``existence_error(engine, Engine)``

Examples
--------

::

   % post the atom "ready" to the worker_1 engine queue:
   | ?- threaded_engine_post(worker_1, ready).
