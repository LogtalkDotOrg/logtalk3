``instantiates_class/2-3``
==========================

Description
-----------

::

   instantiates_class(Instance, Class)
   instantiates_class(Instance, Class, Scope)

Enumerates, by backtracking, all pairs of objects such that the first
one instantiates the second. The relation scope is represented by the
atoms ``public``, ``protected``, and ``private``.

Modes and number of proofs
--------------------------

::

   instantiates_class(?object_identifier, ?object_identifier) - zero_or_more
   instantiates_class(?object_identifier, ?object_identifier, ?scope) - zero_or_more

Errors
------

| ``Instance`` is neither a variable nor a valid object identifier:
|     ``type_error(object_identifier, Instance)``
| ``Class`` is neither a variable nor a valid object identifier:
|     ``type_error(object_identifier, Class)``
| ``Scope`` is neither a variable nor an atom:
|     ``type_error(atom, Scope)``
| ``Scope`` is an atom but an invalid entity scope:
|     ``domain_error(scope, Scope)``

Examples
--------

::

   % check that the water_jug is an instante of state_space:
   | ?- instantiates_class(water_jug, state_space).

   % enumerate the state_space instances where the
   % instantiation relation is public:
   | ?- instantiates_class(Space, state_space, public).
