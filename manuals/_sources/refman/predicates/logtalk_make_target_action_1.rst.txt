Description
-----------

::

   logtalk_make_target_action(Target)

Multifile and dynamic hook predicate that allows defining user actions for
the :ref:`predicates_logtalk_make_1` targets. The user defined actions are
run after the default ones using a failure driven loop. This loop does not
catch any exceptions thrown when calling the user-defined actions.

Modes and number of proofs
--------------------------

   % integrate the dead_code_scanner tool with logtalk_make/1

   :- multifile(logtalk_make_target_action/1).
   :- dynamic(logtalk_make_target_action/1).

   logtalk_make_target_action(check) :-
