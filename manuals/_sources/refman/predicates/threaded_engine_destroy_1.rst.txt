**built-in predicate**

.. index:: pair: threaded_engine_destroy/1; Built-in predicate
.. _predicates_threaded_engine_destroy_1:

``threaded_engine_destroy/1``
=============================

Description
-----------

::

   threaded_engine_destroy(Engine)

Stops and destroys an engine.

.. note::

   This predicate requires a :term:`backend Prolog compiler` providing
   compatible multi-threading primitives. The value of the read-only
   :ref:`engines <flag_engines>` flag is set to ``supported`` when that
   is the case.

Modes and number of proofs
--------------------------

::

   threaded_engine_destroy(@nonvar) - one

Errors
------

| ``Engine`` is a variable:
|     ``instantiation_error``
| ``Engine`` is neither a variable nor the name of an existing engine:
|     ``existence_error(engine, Engine)``

Examples
--------

::

   % stop the worker_1 engine:
   | ?- threaded_engine_destroy(worker_1).

   % stop all engines:
   | ?- forall(
            threaded_engine(Engine),
            threaded_engine_destroy(Engine)
        ).
