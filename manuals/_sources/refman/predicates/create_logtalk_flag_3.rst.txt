``create_logtalk_flag/3``
=========================

Description
-----------

::

   create_logtalk_flag(Flag, Value, Options)

Creates a new Logtalk flag and sets its default value. User-defined
flags can be queried and set in the same way as predefined flags by
using, respectively, the :ref:`predicates_current_logtalk_flag_2` and
:ref:`predicates_set_logtalk_flag_2` built-in predicates. For a
description of the predefined compiler flags, please see the
:ref:`programming_flags` section in the User Manual.

This predicate is based on the specification of the SWI-Prolog
``create_prolog_flag/3`` built-in predicate and supports the same
options: ``access(Access)``, where ``Access`` can be either
``read_write`` (the default) or ``read_only``; ``keep(Keep)``, where
``Keep`` can be either ``false`` (the default) or ``true``, for deciding
if an existing definition of the flag should be kept or replaced by the
new one; and ``type(Type)`` for specifying the type of the flag, which
can be ``boolean``, ``atom``, ``integer``, ``float``, or ``term`` (which
only restricts the flag value to ground terms). When the ``type/1``
option is not specified, the type of the flag is inferred from its
initial value.

Modes and number of proofs
--------------------------

::

   create_logtalk_flag(+atom, +ground, +list(ground)) - one

Errors
------

| ``Flag`` is a variable:
|     ``instantiation_error``
| ``Value`` is not a ground term:
|     ``instantiation_error``
| ``Options`` is not a ground term:
|     ``instantiation_error``
| ``Flag`` is neither a variable nor an atom:
|     ``type_error(atom, Flag)``
| ``Options`` is neither a variable nor a list:
|     ``type_error(atom, Flag)``
| ``Value`` is not a valid value for flag Flag:
|     ``domain_error(flag_value, Flag + Value)``
| ``Flag`` is a system-defined flag:
|     ``permission_error(modify, flag, Flag)``
| An element ``Option`` of the list ``Options`` is not a valid option
|    domain_error(flag_option,Option)
| The list ``Options`` contains a ``type(Type)`` option and ``Value`` is not of type ``Type``
|    type_error(Type, Value)

Examples
--------

::

   % create a new boolean flag with default value set to false: 
   | ?- create_logtalk_flag(pretty_print_blobs, false, []).
