``logtalk_library_path/2``
==========================

Description
-----------

::

   logtalk_library_path(Library, Path)

Dynamic and multifile user-defined predicate, allowing the declaration
of aliases to :term:`library` paths. Library aliases may also be used on
the second argument (using the notation *alias(path)*). Paths must always
end with the path directory separator character (``'/'``).

.. warning::

   Library aliases should be unique. The :ref:`predicates_logtalk_make_1`
   built-in predicate can be used to detect and report duplicated library 
   aliases using the ``check`` target.

Relative paths (e.g. ``'../'`` or ``'./'``) should only be used within
the *alias(path)*) notation so that library paths can always be expanded
to absolute paths independently of the (usually unpredictable) current
directory at the time the ``logtalk_library_path/2`` predicate is
called.

When working with a relocatable application, the actual application
installation directory can be retrieved by calling the
:ref:`predicates_logtalk_load_context_2` predicate with the ``directory``
key and using the returned value to define the ``logtalk_library_path/2``
predicate. On a :term:`settings file` file or a :term:`loader file` file,
simply use an :ref:`directives_initialization_1` directive to wrap the
call to the ``logtalk_load_context/2`` predicate and the assert of the
``logtalk_library_path/2`` fact.

This predicate may be used to override the default :term:`scratch directory`
by defining the library alias ``scratch_directory`` in a backend Prolog
initialization file (assumed to be loaded prior to Logtalk loading). This
allows e.g. Logtalk to be installed in a read-only directory by setting
this alias to the operating-system directory for temporary files. It also
allows several Logtalk instances to run concurrently without conflict by
using a unique scratch directory per instance (e.g. using a process ID or
a UUID generator).

This predicate may be used to override the default location used by the
:doc:`../../devtools/packs` tool to store registries and packs by defining
the ``logtalk_packs`` library alias in settings file or in a backend
Prolog initialization file (assumed to be loaded prior to Logtalk loading).

The :ref:`logtalk <objects_logtalk>` built-in object provides an
:ref:`expand_library_path/2 <apis:logtalk/0::expand_library_path/2>`
predicate that can be used to expand library aliases and files expressed
using library notation.
