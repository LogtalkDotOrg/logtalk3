.. _directives_else_0:

``else/0``
==========

Description
-----------

::

   else

Starts an *else* branch when performing conditional compilation. The
code following this directive is compiled iff the goal in the matching
:ref:`directives_if_1` or :ref:`directives_elif_1` directive is false.

Template and modes
------------------

::

   else

Examples
--------

An example where a hypothetic application would have some limitations
that the user should be made aware when running on a backend Prolog
compiler with bounded arithmetic:

::

   :- if(current_prolog_flag(bounded, true)).

       :- initialization(
           logtalk::print_message(warning,app,bounded_arithmetic)
       ).
   
   :- else.

       :- initialization(
           logtalk::print_message(comment,app,unbounded_arithmetic)
       ).

   :- endif.
