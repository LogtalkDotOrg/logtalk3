======================

Description
-----------

::

   set_logtalk_flag(Flag, Value)

Sets local flag values. The scope of this directive is the entity or
the source file containing it. For global scope, use the corresponding
:ref:`predicates_set_logtalk_flag_2` built-in predicate called from an
:ref:`directives_initialization_1` directive. For a description of the
predefined compiler flags, consult the :ref:`programming_flags`
section in the User Manual. The directive affects the compilation of
all terms that follow it within scope of the directive.

       :- set_logtalk_flag(events, allow).
       ...

       % turn off suspicious call lint checks for the next predicate:
