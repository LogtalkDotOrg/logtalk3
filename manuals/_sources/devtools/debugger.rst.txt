``debugger``
============

This tool provides the default Logtalk command-line debugger. Unlike
Prolog systems, the Logtalk debugger is a regular application, using a
public API. As a consequence, it must be explicitly loaded by the
programmer, either manually at the top-level interpreter or
automatically from a settings file.

API documentation
-----------------

This tool API documentation is available at:

`../../docs/library_index.html#debugger <../../docs/library_index.html#debugger>`__

Loading
-------

This tool can be loaded using the query:

::

   | ?- logtalk_load(debugger(loader)).

Note that this tool cannot be loaded at the same time as other tools
(e.g. the ports profiler) that also provide a debug handler, which must
be unique in a running session.

When the code to be debugged runs computationally expensive
initializations, loading this tool after the code may have a noticeable
impact in loading times.

Testing
-------

To test this tool, load the ``tester.lgt`` file:

::

   | ?- logtalk_load(debugger(tester)).

Usage
-----

Debugging Logtalk source code (with this debugger) requires compiling
source files using the ``debug(on)`` compiler flag. For example:

::

   | ?- logtalk_load(my_buggy_code, [debug(on)]).

In alternative, you may also turn on the ``debug`` flag globally by
typing:

::

   | ?- set_logtalk_flag(debug, on).

But note that loader files may override this flag setting (e.g. by using
``debug(off)`` or ``optimize(on)`` options for loaded files). If that's
the case, you will need to either edit the loader files or write
customized loader files enabling debugging. For detailed information on
using the debugger, consult the debugging section of the User Manual:

`../../manuals/userman/debugging.html <../../manuals/userman/debugging.html>`__

The ``debugger_messages.lgt`` source file defines the default debugger
message translations.

The ``dump_trace.lgt`` provides a simple solution for dumping a goal
trace to a file. For example:

::

   | ?- dump_trace::start_redirect_to_file('trace.txt', some_goal),
        dump_trace::stop_redirect_to_file.

Alternative debugger tools
--------------------------

Logtalk provides basic support for the SWI-Prolog graphical tracer. The
**required** settings are described in the ``settings-sample.lgt`` file.
Logtalk queries can be traced using this tool by using the
``gtrace/0-1`` predicates. For example:

::

   | ?- gtrace(foo::bar).

or:

::

   | ?- gtrace, foo::bar.

You can also use the ``gspy/1`` predicate to spy a Logtalk predicate
specified as ``Entity::Functor/Arity`` when using the graphical tracer.
When using this tool, internal Logtalk compiler/runtime predicates and
compiled predicates that resulted from the term-expansion mechanism may
be exposed in some cases. This issue is shared with Prolog code and
results from the non-availability of source code for the predicates
being traced.

Known issues
------------

Line number spy points (aka breakpoints) require a Prolog backend
compiler that supports accessing read term starting line but only some
backends (B-Prolog, GNU Prolog, JIProlog, Lean Prolog, LVM, SICStus
Prolog, SWI-Prolog, and YAP) provide accurate line numbers.

As a workaround, you can check the start line number for an entity
predicate definition using a query such as:

::

   | ?- object_property(Entity, defines(Functor/Arity, Properties)).

and checking the returned ``line_count/1`` property to find if there's
any offset to the source file number of the predicate clause that you
want to trace. This issue, if present, usually only affects the first
predicate clause.

Line number spy points are currently not available when using XSB as the
Prolog backend compiler.
