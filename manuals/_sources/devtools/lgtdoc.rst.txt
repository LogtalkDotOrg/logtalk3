``lgtdoc``
==========

This folder provides the default Logtalk documenting tool, which is
focused on generating API documentation for applications.

This documenting tool uses Logtalkâ€™s structural reflection support to
extract and output in XML format relevant documentation about a source
code file, a library or directory of source files, or all loaded source
files. The tool predicates allows you to set several options for the XML
files, including the output directory.

API documentation
-----------------

To consult this tool API documentation, open in a web browser the link:

`docs/library_index.html#lgtdoc <https://logtalk.org/docs/library_index.html#lgtdoc>`__

Loading
-------

This tool can be loaded using the query:

::

   | ?- logtalk_load(lgtdoc(loader)).

Documenting source code
-----------------------

Documenting Logtalk source code (with this tool) requires compiling the
source files using the ``source_data(on)`` compiler flag. For example:

::

   | ?- logtalk_load(source_file, [source_data(on)]).

In alternative, you may also turn on the ``source_data`` flag globally
by typing:

::

   | ?- set_logtalk_flag(source_data, on).

The tool API allows generating documentation for libraries, directories,
and files, complemented with library, directory, entity, and predicate
indexes. The source files to be documented **must** be loaded prior to
using this tool predicates to generate the documentation.

The ``lgtdoc/xml`` directory includes several ready to use scripts for
converting the XML documenting files to (X)HTML, PDF, Markdown,
reStructuredText (for use with Sphinx), or plain text files. See the
``lgtdoc/xml/NOTES.md`` for details.

Other notes
-----------

All source files are formatted using tabs (the recommended setting is a
tab width equivalent to 4 spaces).
