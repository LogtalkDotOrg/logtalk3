``asdf``
========

A Logtalk plugin for the `asdf <https://asdf-vm.com/#/>`__ extendable
version manager is available at:

`https://github.com/LogtalkDotOrg/asdf-logtalk <https://github.com/LogtalkDotOrg/asdf-logtalk>`__

This plugin provides an alternative to the ``logtalk_version_select``
script that can be useful to manage Logtalk versions when developing
solutions that use other languages and tools that can also be handled by
``asdf``.
