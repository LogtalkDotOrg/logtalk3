.. _library_git:

``git``
=======

This library provides access to a git project current branch and latest
commit data (e.g. commit hash). Support for using this library on
Windows operating-systems is experimental and may or may not work
depending on the used Prolog backend.

Loading
-------

To load all entities in this library, load the ``loader.lgt`` file:

::

   | ?- logtalk_load(git(loader)).

Testing
-------

To test this library predicates, load the ``tester.lgt`` file:

::

   | ?- logtalk_load(git(tester)).

Usage
-----

All predicates take as first argument a directory, which should be
either a git repository directory or a sub-directory of a git repository
directory. The main predicate is ``commit_log/3``. It provides access to
the ``git log`` command when called with the
``--oneline -n 1 --pretty=format:`` options. By passing as second
argument the desired format, it returns an atom with the formatted
output. For example:

::

   | ?- git::commit_log('/Users/pmoura/logtalk3', '%h%n%B', Output),
        write(Output), nl.

   eccaa1a2a
   Update SVG diagrams

   Output = 'eccaa1a2a\nUpdate SVG diagrams\n'
   yes

See e.g. the official documentation on ``git log`` pretty formats for
details:

https://git-scm.com/docs/pretty-formats

Convenient predicates are also provided for common used formats such as
the commit author and the commit hash. For example:

::

   | ?- git::commit_author('/Users/pmoura/Documents/Logtalk/logtalk3', Author).

   Author = 'Paulo Moura'
   yes

   | ?- git::commit_hash('/Users/pmoura/Documents/Logtalk/logtalk3', Hash).

   Hash = eccaa1a2a9495fef441915bbace84e0a4b0394a2
   yes

It's also possible to get the name of the current local branch. For
example:

::

   | ?- git::branch('/Users/pmoura/Documents/Logtalk/logtalk3', Branch).

   Branch = master
   yes
