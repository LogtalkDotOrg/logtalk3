Dynamic object attributes
=========================

In this example, we will illustrate the use of:

-  categories
-  category predicates
-  dynamic predicates

by defining a category that implements a set of predicates for handling
dynamic object attributes.

.. _category:

Defining a category
-------------------

We want to define a set of predicates to handle dynamic object
attributes. We need public predicates to set, get, and delete
attributes, and a private dynamic predicate to store the attributes
values. Let us name these predicates ``set_attribute/2`` and
``get_attribute/2``, for getting and setting an attribute value,
``del_attribute/2`` and ``del_attributes/2``, for deleting attributes,
and ``attribute_/2``, for storing the attributes values.

But we do not want to encapsulate these predicates in an object. Why?
Because they are a set of useful, closely related, predicates that may
be used by several, unrelated, objects. If defined at an object level,
we would be constrained to use inheritance in order to have the
predicates available to other objects. Furthermore, this could force us
to use multi-inheritance or to have some kind of generic root object
containing all kinds of possible useful predicates.

For this kind of situation, Logtalk enables the programmer to
encapsulate the predicates in a *category*, so that they can be used in
any object. A category is a Logtalk entity, at the same level as objects
and protocols. It can contain predicates directives and/or definitions.
Category predicates can be imported by any object, without code
duplication and without resorting to inheritance.

When defining category predicates, we need to remember that a category
can be imported by more than one object. Thus, the calls to the built-in
methods that handle the private dynamic predicate (such as
:ref:`methods_assertz_1` or :ref:`methods_retract_1`) must be made
either in the context of *self*, using the *message to self* control
structure, :ref:`control_send_to_self_1`, or in
the context of *this* (i.e. in the context of the object importing the
category). This way, we ensure that when we call one of the attribute
predicates on an object, the intended object own definition of
``attribute_/2`` will be used. The predicates definitions are
straightforward. For example, if opting for storing the attributes in
*self*:

::

   :- category(attributes).

       :- public(set_attribute/2).
       :- mode(set_attribute(+nonvar, +nonvar), one).

       :- public(get_attribute/2).
       :- mode(get_attribute(?nonvar, ?nonvar), zero_or_more).

       :- public(del_attribute/2).
       :- mode(del_attribute(?nonvar, ?nonvar), zero_or_more).

       :- public(del_attributes/2).
       :- mode(del_attributes(@term, @term), one).

       :- private(attribute_/2).
       :- mode(attribute_(?nonvar, ?nonvar), zero_or_more).
       :- dynamic(attribute_/2).

       set_attribute(Attribute, Value):-
           ::retractall(attribute_(Attribute, _)),
           ::assertz(attribute_(Attribute, Value)).

       get_attribute(Attribute, Value):-
           ::attribute_(Attribute, Value).

       del_attribute(Attribute, Value):-
           ::retract(attribute_(Attribute, Value)).

       del_attributes(Attribute, Value):-
           ::retractall(attribute_(Attribute, Value)).

   :- end_category.

The alternative, opting for storing the attributes on *this*, is
similar: just delete the uses of the ``(::)/1`` control structure from the
code above.

We have two new directives, :ref:`directives_category_1_4` and
:ref:`directives_end_category_0`, that
encapsulate the category code. If needed, we can put the predicates
directives inside a protocol that will be implemented by the category:

::

   :- category(attributes,
       implements(attributes_protocol)).

       ...

   :- end_category.

Any protocol can be implemented by either an object, a category, or
both.

.. _importing:

Importing the category
----------------------

We reuse a category's predicates by importing them into an object:

::

   :- object(person,
       imports(attributes)).

       ...

   :- end_object.

After compiling and loading this object and our category, we can now try
queries like:

.. code-block:: text

   | ?- person::set_attribute(name, paulo).

   yes

   | ?- person::set_attribute(gender, male).

   yes

   | ?- person::get_attribute(Attribute, Value).

   Attribute = name, Value = paulo ;
   Attribute = gender, Value = male ;
   no

Summary
-------

-  Categories are similar to objects: we just write our predicate
   directives and definitions bracketed by opening and ending category
   directives.

-  An object reuses a category by importing it. The imported predicates
   behave as if they have been defined in the object itself.

-  When do we use a category instead of an object? Whenever we have a
   set of closely related predicates that we want to reuse in several,
   unrelated, objects without being constrained by inheritance
   relations. Thus, categories can be interpreted as object building
   components.
