.. _faq_programming_either_prototypes_classes:

Should I use prototypes or classes in my application?
-----------------------------------------------------

Prototypes and classes provide different patterns of code reuse. A
prototype encapsulates code that can be used by itself and by its
descendent prototypes. A class encapsulates code to be used by its
descendent instances. Prototypes provide the best replacement to the
use of modules as encapsulation units, avoiding the need to
instantiate a class in order to access its code.

.. _faq_programming_both_prototypes_classes:

Can I use both classes and prototypes in the same application?
--------------------------------------------------------------

Yes. In addition, you may freely exchange messages between
prototypes, classes, and instances.

.. _faq_programming_hierarchy:

Can I mix classes and prototypes in the same hierarchy?
-------------------------------------------------------

No. However, you may define as many prototype hierarchies and class
hierarchies and classes as needed by your application.

.. _faq_programming_protocols_categories:

Can I use a protocol or a category with both prototypes and classes?
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Yes. A protocol may be implemented by both prototypes and classes in
the same application. Likewise, a category may be imported by both
prototypes and classes in the same application.

.. _faq_programming_components:

What support is provided in Logtalk for defining and using components?
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Logtalk supports component-based programming (since its inception on
January 1998), by using *categories* (which are first-class entities
like objects and protocols). Logtalk categories can be used with both
classes and prototypes and are inspired on the Smalltalk-80
(documentation-only) concept of method categories and on Objective-C
categories, hence the name. For more information, please consult the
:ref:`categories_categories` section and the examples provided with
the distribution.

.. _faq_programming_reflection:

What support is provided in Logtalk for reflective programming?
---------------------------------------------------------------

Logtalk supports meta-classes, behavioral reflection through the use
of event-driven programming, and structural reflection through the
use of a set of built-in predicates and built-in methods which allow
us to query the system about existing entities, entity relations, and
entity predicates.
