.. _faq_portability_prolog:

Are my Logtalk applications portable across Prolog compilers?
-------------------------------------------------------------

Yes, as long you don't use built-in predicates or special features
only available on some Prolog compilers. There is a
:ref:`portability <flag_portability>` compiler flag that you can set
to instruct Logtalk to print a warning for each occurrence of non-ISO
Prolog standard features such as proprietary built-in predicates. In
addition, it is advisable that you constrain, if possible, the use of
platform or compiler dependent code to a small number of objects with
clearly defined protocols. You may also use Logtalk support for
conditional compilation to compile different entity or predicate
definitions depending on the backend Prolog compiler being used.

.. _faq_portability_os:

Are my Logtalk applications portable across operating systems?
--------------------------------------------------------------

Yes, as long you don't use built-in predicates or special features
that your chosen backend Prolog compiler only supports in some
operating-systems. You may need to change the end-of-lines characters
of your source files to match the ones on the target operating system
and the expectations of your Prolog compiler. Some Prolog compilers
silently fail to compile source files with the wrong end-of-lines
characters.
