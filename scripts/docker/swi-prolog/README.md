Logtalk Docker configuration for SWI-Prolog
===========================================

Build arguments
---------------

- `LOGTALK_VERSION`  
The Logtalk version to be built.

Valid identifiers are as shown in the Logtalk GitHub repository at [release names](https://github.com/LogtalkDotOrg/logtalk3/releases). Defaults to `master`, which causes the Docker image to be built with the latest version of Logtalk in its master branch.

Volumes
-------

- `/source`  
The work directory where Logtalk is started. The code base can be mounted here.

- `/logtalkuser_prefix`  
If the user would like to customize its installation, he could mount in this volume the parent directory in its host system where it is located the custom Logtalk user directory. If no Logtalk user directory exists, it will be created the first time and will be persisted and used in the following executions of the Logtalk container.
