This directory contains files and resources required to run Logtalk in a
Docker container. It also contains the read-me files that are displayed
at Docker Hub. The files are organized in directories per supported
backend Prolog compiler. Note that we are currently limited to Prolog
systems with available Docker containers. Each one of these directories
includes the following files:

- `Dockerfile`  
	the docker file configuring Logtalk with a specific Prolog engine

- `README.md`  
	the `README.md` file automatically used as the project description
	when creating an automated build at Docker Hub

The stable and nightly Docker images are available for downloading at
the Docker Hub website:

	https://hub.docker.com/u/logtalk/
