This directory contains example scripts for creating YAP Prolog files
from Logtalk core files and Logtalk source files.

The following scripts are provided:

- `yap_logtalk_pl.sh`  
	creates a `logtalk.pl` file with the Logtalk compiler and runtime
	and an optional `application.pl` file for an application

See the script usage examples in the `../SCRIPT.txt` file on how to
create a YAP saved state that includes a Logtalk application.
