%description
Logtalk is a declarative object-oriented logic programming language that extends and leverages the Prolog language with modern code encapsulation and code reuse mechanisms while also providing improved predicate semantics. As a multi-paradigm language, it includes support for modules, prototypes, classes, protocols (interfaces), categories (components and hot patching), event-driven programming, and high-level multi-threading programming.
