This directory contains files used when building Linux RPM packages.

The `build_rpm.sh` shell script makes the following assumptions:

(1) The `~/.rpmmacros` configuration file contains the definition:

	%packager      Paulo Moura <pmoura@logtalk.org>
	%distribution  Logtalk.org
	%vendor        Logtalk.org
	%_topdir       %(echo $HOME)/rpmbuild
	%_tmppath     /var/tmp

(2) The `~/rpmbuild` directory structure already exists. The command
`rpmdev-setuptree` can be used to create these structure. In alternative,
the directory structure can be manually created using the commands:

	$ cd $HOME
	$ mkdir rpmbuild
	$ cd rpmbuild
	$ mkdir RPMS SOURCES SPECS SRPMS BUILD

The necessary `logtalk.spec` file is generated by the `build_rpm.sh`
shell script by processing the `logtalk.spec.in` file.
