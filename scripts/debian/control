Description: Logtalk - Object-Oriented Logic Programming Language
 Logtalk is an object-oriented logic programming language that extends
 and leverages the Prolog language with a feature set suitable for
 programming in the large. As a multi-paradigm language, it includes
 support for both prototypes and classes, protocols (interfaces),
 component-based programming through category-based composition,
 event-driven programming, coinduction, and high-level multi-threading
 programming. Logtalk uses standard Prolog syntax with the addition of
 some operators and directives and can be used with any Prolog
 implementation compliant with official and de facto standards as the
 backend compiler.
