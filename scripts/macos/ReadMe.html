<h2>About</h2>

<p>Logtalk is a <em>declarative object-oriented logic programming language</em> that
extends and leverages the Prolog language with a feature set suitable for
programming in the large. Logtalk supports modern code encapsulation and
code reuse mechanisms without compromising the declarative programming
features of Prolog.</p>

<p>Logtalk is implemented as a trans-compiler in highly portable code and can
use most modern and standards compliant Prolog implementations as a backend
compiler.</p>

<p>As a multi-paradigm language, Logtalk includes support for both <em>prototypes</em>
and <em>classes</em>, <em>protocols</em> (<em>interfaces</em>), <em>categories</em> (components and
hot-patching), <em>event-driven programming</em>, <em>coinduction</em>, <em>lambda expressions</em>,
and <em>high-level multi-threading programming</em>. Logtalk uses standard Prolog
syntax with the addition of some operators and directives for a smooth learning
path.</p>

<p>Logtalk is distributed under a commercial friendly license and includes full
documentation, portable libraries, portable developer tools, and a large number
of programming examples to help get you started.

<p>Logtalk can be installed either from sources by running a few shell scripts 
or by using one of the provided installers, depending on your operating 
system. For manual installation, see the file <code>INSTALL.md</code> for detailed 
instructions.</p>

<p>See the user manual for a description of the source files organization 
and for using instructions (to read the user manual open the file 
<code>manuals/index.html</code> with a web browser).</p>

<p>If you are upgrading from a previous Logtalk version, please check the
<code>UPGRADING.md</code> file for instructions on how to upgrade your
programs or your custom adapter files to run under this new version.</p>

<h2>Customization</h2>

<p>The file <code>CUSTOMIZE.md</code> provides detailed instructions for customizing the  
Logtalk installation and working environment.</p>

<h2>Running</h2>

<p>The file <code>QUICK_START.md</code> provides quick instructions for those of you in a hurry 
to run Logtalk, provided that your favorite Prolog compiler is supported.</p>

<h2>Documentation</h2>

<p>A quick and highly recommended introduction for users comfortable with Prolog
and with general knowledge about object-oriented programming is available at
<a href="https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/logtalk/">Learn X in Y minutes website</a>.</p>

<p>The HTML version of the Logtalk Handbook is included with the sources and can
be found in the <code>manuals</code> directory. It's also available online at the 
<a href="https://logtalk.org/manuals/index.html">Logtalk website</a>.</p>

<p>The Handbook is the entry point for the Logtalk documentation. It includes the
user manual, the reference manual, glossary, FAQ, the library overviews, plus
the developer tools documentation.</p>

<p>The <code>RELEASE_NOTES.md</code> file contains descriptions of all
Logtalk updates since the first public version. Check it carefully if you
have been using a previous Logtalk version.</p>

<p>The API documentation for the core, library, tools, and contributions entities
is provided in XHTML format and can be found in the <code>docs</code> directory and
also available online on the <a href="https://logtalk.org/library/index.html">Logtalk website</a>.</p>

<p>Most directories include <code>NOTES.md</code> or <code>NOTES.txt</code> documentation files.</p>

<p>On POSIX systems, there's also a man page for most shell scripts.
A list of these scripts can be generated using the <code>apropos logtalk</code> command.
<a href="https://logtalk.org/man/">HTML versions of the man pages</a> are also available
at the Logtalk website.
