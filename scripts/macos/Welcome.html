<b>Welcome to the Logtalk for macOS Installer</b>
</p>
<p>
Logtalk is an open source object-oriented logic programming language that can use most Prolog implementations as a backend compiler. As a multi-paradigm language, it includes support for both prototypes and classes, protocols (interfaces), component-based programming through category-based composition, event-driven programming, and high-level multi-threading programming.
</p>
<p>
Logtalk <b>requires</b> a compatible Prolog compiler to be installed in order to run.
</p>
<p>
This installer guides you through the steps necessary to install Logtalk for macOS. Logtalk is installed in the <b>/opt/local/share/logtalk</b> directory. A link to this directory is automatically created in the <b>/Applications</b> directory. Links to the Prolog integration scripts are created in the <b>/opt/local/bin</b> directory. Links to the script man pages are created in the <b>/opt/local/man</b> directory. The Texinfo versions of the Handbook and APIs documentation are copied to the <b>/opt/local/share/info</b> directory. The installer adds these directories to, respectively, the <b>PATH</b>, <b>MANPATH</b>, and <b>INFOPATH</b> systems environment variables for the <b>bash</b>, <b>zsh</b>, and <b>csh</b> shells.
</p>
<p>
After installation, each Logtalk user should run the shell command <b>logtalk_user_setup</b> once to create a <b>logtalk</b> directory in the user's home directory containing library files, examples, and documentation.
