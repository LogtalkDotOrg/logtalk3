This directory contains some shell scripts used for Logtalk packaging, 
installation, and integration with Prolog compilers. Those with extension 
`.sh` are bash shells scripts for MacOS X, Linux, and similar systems.
Those with extension `.js` are JScript command-line scripts for Windows;
they require WSH 5.6 or later version to be installed and should be run
using `cscript.exe` from a DOS command line shell (you may download WSH 5.6
from `http://msdn.microsoft.com/downloads/list/webdev.asp`).

- `build_release.sh`  
	helper script for building most of the distribution files of a new 
	Logtalk release

- `cleandist.sh`  
	script for cleaning a Logtalk distribution in preparation for packaging

- `install.sh`  
	shell script for installing Logtalk in a system-wide location for Unix 
	and Unix-like operating systems (must be run from this directory by a 
	user with administration privileges; accepts as an optional argument 
	a prefix for the installation directory: default is `/opt/local` on 
	Darwin (MacOS X), `/usr` on Debian systems, and `/usr/local` on other 
	POSIX systems, resulting in Logtalk being installed in `$prefix/share`
	with useful scripts written to `$prefix/bin`, which should be in your
	path)

- `uninstall.sh`  
	shell script for de-installing Logtalk in Unix and Unix-like operating 
	systems (must be run from this directory by a user with administration 
	privileges)

- `logtalk_version_select.sh`  
	experimental shell script for switching between installed Logtalk
	versions for POSIX operating-systems; works with version 2.36.0 or
	later; doesn't change the Logtalk user folder; this script is loosely
	based on the `python_select` script

- `logtalk_backend_select.sh`  
	experimental shell script for defining an alias, logtalk, to a chosen
	back-end Prolog integration script for POSIX operating-systems; the
	alias is created in same directory where the `*lgt` integration scripts
	are found

- `debian`  
	directory containing support files for building a Debian package
	(work in progress; experimental)

- `freedesktop`  
	directory containing support files for adding the Logtalk mime-type
	to the freedesktop.org shared mime-info database

- `linux`  
	directory containing files used when building

- `macosx`  
	directory containing files used when building MacOS X installer 
	packages

- `windows`  
	directory containing files used when building Windows GUI installers

- `logtalk_user_setup.sh`  
- `logtalk_user_setup.js`  
	end-user scripts for copying the Logtalk user-modifiable files and 
	directories to the location pointed by the environment variable 
	LOGTALKUSER (defaults to `~/logtalk` on POSIX operating-systems 
	and to `My Documents\Logtalk` on Windows when the variable is not 
	defined); must be run by each end-user in order to ensure proper 
	permissions for the copied files; the `LOGTALKHOME` environment 
	variable must be defined (pointing to the Logtalk installation 
	directory)
- `logtalk_user_setup.bat`  
    wrapper for the logtalk_user_setup.js script to simplify its use
