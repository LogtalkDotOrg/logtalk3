This folder contains a Logtalk version of John Fletcher's Prolog XML 
parser:

	https://binding-time.co.uk/index.php/Parsing_XML_with_Prolog

To load this XML parser and for sample queries, please see the `SCRIPT.txt` 
file.

For a detailed description of this XML parser, please see the comments 
in the `xml.lgt` source file or convert the automatically generated 
documentation to HTML or PDF.

See the copyright and license information on the contributed files for 
usage and distributions conditions.

When using GNU Prolog as the backend compiler, you may need to to use a
larger default global stack size (see the GNU Prolog documentation on the
environment variable `GLOBALSZ`).
