The Sphinx configuration file, `conf.py`, is renamed in this directory
to `_conf.py` to avoid being picked up by the Read the Docs website
builds. This file is temporarily renamed to the correct name by the
`update_html_docs.sh` script.

The `_templates/layout.html` file adds the links to the SVG diagrams
and the index to the sidebar of the generated HTML documentation.
