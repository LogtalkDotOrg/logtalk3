``mode_non_terminal/2``
=======================

Description
-----------

::

   mode_non_terminal(Mode, NumberOfProofs)

Most non-terminals can be used with several instantiations modes. This
directive enables the specification of each
:ref:`instantiation mode <predicates_mode_instantiation>` and the
corresponding :ref:`number of proofs <predicates_mode_number_of_proofs>`
(but not necessarily distinct solutions). The instantiation mode of
each argument can include type information.

Template and modes
------------------

::

   mode_non_terminal(+predicate_mode_term, +number_of_proofs)
   mode_non_terminal(+non_terminal_mode_term, +number_of_proofs)

Examples
--------

::

   :- mode_non_terminal(zero_or_more(-list(atomic)), one).
