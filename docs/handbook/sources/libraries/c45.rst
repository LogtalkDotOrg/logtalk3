``c45``
=======

This library implements the C4.5 decision tree learning algorithm. C4.5
is an extension of the ID3 algorithm that uses information gain ratio
instead of information gain for attribute selection, which avoids bias
towards attributes with many values.

The library provides predicates for learning a decision tree from a
dataset and exporting the learned tree as a list of predicate clauses or
to a file.

Datasets are represented as objects implementing the
``dataset_protocol`` protocol. This protocol defines the following
predicates:

- ``attribute_values/2`` - enumerates attributes and their possible
  values
- ``class/1`` - returns the name of the target class attribute
- ``class_values/1`` - returns the list of possible class values
- ``example/3`` - enumerates the examples in the dataset

Test datasets
-------------

Two sample datasets are included in the ``test_files`` directory:

- **Play Tennis** — The classic weather/tennis dataset with 14 examples
  and 4 attributes (outlook, temperature, humidity, wind). Originally
  from Quinlan (1986) and widely used in machine learning textbooks
  including Mitchell (1997). Also available from the UCI Machine
  Learning Repository:
  https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/349/tennis+major+tournament+match+statistics

- **Contact Lenses** — A dataset with 24 examples and 4 attributes (age,
  spectacle prescription, astigmatism, tear production rate) for
  deciding the type of contact lenses to prescribe. Originally from

::

   | ?- logtalk_load(c45(loader)).

Testing
-------

To test this library predicates, load the ``tester.lgt`` file:

Usage
-----

To learn a decision tree from a dataset:

::

   | ?- c45::learn(play_tennis, Tree).

To export the tree as a list of predicate clauses:

::

   | ?- c45::learn(play_tennis, Tree),
        c45::tree_to_clauses(play_tennis, Tree, classify, Clauses).

To export the tree to a file:

::

   | ?- c45::learn(play_tennis, Tree),
        c45::tree_to_file(play_tennis, Tree, classify, 'tree.pl').

To print the tree to the current output:

::

   | ?- c45::learn(play_tennis, Tree),
        c45::print_tree(Tree).
