.SH NAME
sicstuslgt \- Logtalk integration script for SICStus Prolog

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B sicstuslgt
[\fB--noinfo\fR]
[\fB--goal \fIgoal\fR]

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBsicstuslgt\fR is a Logtalk integration script for SICStus Prolog. It automatically loads the SICStus Prolog adapter file, the Logtalk compiler and runtime, the Logtalk default table of library names and paths, and any existing settings file found on the lookup directories. It uses the \fBsicstus\fR executable \fB-l\fR option to load the Logtalk files. It passes any options to the \fBsicstus\fR executable; see the SICStus Prolog documentation for the available options.

.SH OPTIONS
The two most common options are:
.TP
.B \--noinfo
Silence Logtalk default startup messages and compilation messages by setting the \fBreport\fR flag to \fBwarnings\fR.
.TP
.B \--goal
.I goal
Initialization goal, written between double quotes, to be executed after Logtalk startup.

.SH REQUIREMENTS
SICStus Prolog 4.1.0 (or later versions) is required. This integration script looks for a \fBsicstus\fR executable in the system path.

.B LOGTALKHOME
Specifies the location of the Logtalk installation.
