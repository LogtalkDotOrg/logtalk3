``halstead_metric(Stroud)``
===========================

* ``Stroud`` - Coeficient for computing the time required to program.


Computes Halstead complexity numbers for an entity.

| **Author:** Paulo Moura
| **Version:** 0.7
| **Date:** 2018/7/18

| **Compilation flags:**
|    ``static, context_switching_calls``


| **Imports:**
|    ``public`` :ref:`code_metrics_utilities <code_metrics_utilities/0>`
|    ``public`` :ref:`code_metric <code_metric/0>`

| **Remarks:**
|    
|    *Definition of operators:* Predicates declared, user-defined, and called are interpreted as operators. Built-in predicates and built-in control constructs are ignored.
|    
|    *Definition of operands:* Predicate arguments are abstracted and interpreted as operands. Note that this definition of operands is a significant deviation from the original definition, which used syntactic literals.
|    
|    *Pn:* Number of distinct predicates (declared, defined, called, or updated)
|    
|    *PAn:* Number of predicate arguments (assumed distinct)
|    
|    *Cn:* Number of predicate calls/updates + number of clauses
|    
|    *CAn:* Number of predicate call/update arguments + number of clause head arguments
|    
|    *EV:* Entity vocabulary: EV = Pn + PAn
|    
|    *EL:* Entity length: EL = Cn + CAn
|    
|    *V:* Volume: V = EL * log2(EV)
|    
|    *D:* Difficulty: D = (Pn/2) * (CAn/An)
|    
|    *E:* Effort: E = D * V
|    
|    *T:* Time required to program: T = E/k seconds (k is the Stroud number; defaults to 18)
|    
|    *B:* Number of delivered bugs: B = V/3000
|    
|    *Entity score:* Represented as the compound term pn_pan_cn_can_ev_el_v_d_e_t_b/11.
