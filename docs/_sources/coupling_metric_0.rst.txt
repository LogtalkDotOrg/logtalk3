Remarks
-------

* **Efferent coupling (Ce)**: Number of entities that an entity depends on.

* **Afferent coupling (Ca)**: Number of entities that depend on an entity.

* **Instability (I)**: Computed as Ce / (Ce + Ca). Measures the entity resilience to change. Ranging from 0 to 1, with 0 indicating a maximally stable entity and 1 indicating a maximally unstable entity. Ideally, an entity is either maximally stable or maximally unstable.

* **Abstractness (A)**: Computed as the ratio between the number of static predicates with scope directives without a local definition and the number of static predicates with scope directives. Measures the rigidity of an entity. Ranging from 0 to 1, with 0 indicating a fully concrete entity and 1 indicating a fully abstract entity.

* **Entity score**: Represented as the compound term ce_ca_i_a(Ce,Ca,I,A).

* **Dependencies count**: Includes direct entity relations plus calls or dynamic updates to predicates in external objects or categories.
