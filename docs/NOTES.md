To consult the documentation for all core, library, tools, and
contributions entities, open the file `index.html` with a web
browser.

This directory also includes SVG inheritance diagrams for the core
entities, the library, ports, developer tools, and contributions:

- `core_inheritance_diagram.svg`
- `library_inheritance_diagram.svg`
- `tools_inheritance_diagram.svg`
- `ports_inheritance_diagram.svg`
- `contributions_inheritance_diagram.svg`

The diagrams embed URL links to both API documentation (at the Logtalk
website) and source code (at the GitHub website).

The API HTML files and the diagrams SVG files are generated by running
the `scripts/update_html_docs.sh` and `scripts/update_svg_diagrams.sh`
shell scripts.

The HTML and Texinfo versions of the documentation are generated from
reStructuredText sources using Sphinx. These sources are automatically
generated by the `lgtdoc` tool. See the `sources/NOTES.md` file for
details. Only the HTML version is included in the sources distribution.
The Texinfo version can be downloaded from the Logtalk website (for
the latest stable release) at:

https://logtalk.org/documentation.html
